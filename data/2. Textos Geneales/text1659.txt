SUNDAY Cecily, USA, Robotics Mechanical Engineer 
at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Graduated in 2014 
I applied to the ISAE-SUPAERO master’s program because I was 
looking for a graduate school that would provide me with both a 
strong academic and personal challenge. In the end, I chose this 
program over my other options because it best satisfied these 
two goals. On one hand, the academic schedule, which includes 
a balance of lecture, research, and work components, matched 
my subject interests and learning objectives. On the other hand, 
I had the opportunity to immerse myself in a foreign language 
and experience first-hand a different culture. Consequently, 
I have found that one of the strongest assets of this program is 
the opportunity to work alongside a culturally diverse group of 
peers. The international aspect of this program creates a number 
of unique opportunities that would not be possible otherwise. 
For example, I was able to choose a research project where I 
collaborate simultaneously with US and French space agencies. 
From a personal standpoint, I now have friends from across the 
world that I can visit and host. Following graduation from this 
program, I began working as a Robotics Mechanical Engineer at the 
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. My current tasks support future 
Mars and Venus missions.
Libin Lalu KOITHARA, India - Graduated in 2015 
Why did you choose ISAE-SUPAERO and apply for our master? 
What were your objectives?
To be very frank, there is no better place to learn about the whole 
Aircraft from scratch than the birth place of Aircraft manufacturer « 
Airbus», Toulouse and the classes at ISAE-SUPAERO are taught by 
highly experience professors and also some of the courses are taught 
by other professors from well reputed research establishments and 
other Aerospace companies (Airbus, DGA etc). ISAE-SUPAERO is 
one of the finest school in the world only for aeronautics. About 
the master «Aerospace Mechanics & Avionics», the syllabus and 
the specializations provided fascinated me to opt for this particular 
master as my higher studies. My objectives were to get the best 
quality education available for the aerospace domain through a 
wide variety of theoretical courses as well as practical training.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the 
Master you did?
I would say the research project studies for one year followed 
by six months end of study projects (Master thesis at Aerospace 
companies). These projects really helped me to enhance my 
capacity to work independently and at the same time aided me

to how to work in a team. These also gave me a chance to work 
closely with a professor who will be a guide or Tutor during my 
tenure. 
Which are your career plans ?
My academic experience has provided me with an excellent 
foundation for my career. The master thesis that I did at Airbus 
Helicopters, Germany has given me some excellent experience in 
the field which has further broadened out my foundation. I look 
forward to working full-time as an aerospace engineer (to be 
precise as a Structural engineer) and gaining more practical work 
experience. In near future I would like to see myself in a position 
heading a team.
Andra TONIE - Croatia, Customer Support Manager, 
Air France Industry - Graduated in 2014
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for our master? What were 
your objectives?
I chose ISAE-SUPAERO after evaluating the best aerospace 
schools in Europe on several criteria: program variety, international 
openness, professional network and reputation. In addition, the 
masters program “Aeronautical and Space Systems” allowed 
me to enter the aerospace world with a B. of Eng. in Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science. My objectives were to get the 
best quality education available for the aerospace industry, through 
a rich program, offering not only courses but also practical projects, 
research and placement in the industry.   
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the 
Master you did?
Definitely the 2 semesters of research (followed by 1 semester 
of thesis) and the strong network ISAE-SUPAERO has with the 
industry. Not only that I managed to publish a paper following my 
research work, but the large project offered me a view of assets 
and work needed in a totally innovative environment, seeing a topic 
in detail, producing results that can be used and from which you 
learn beyond the usual institutional activities; also, all of these, 
while having a research tutor close to answer to all your questions. 
This counted as a strong and reliable work experience the moment 
that I started looking for a job following my masters program, and it 
is also part of the knowledge I use in my current job. 
Which are your career plans?
At this point, I am looking forward to growing inside the company, 
as it offers me great responsibility and opportunities to learn, and 
to moving gradually to even more challenging positions, alongside 
my progress. Bottom line for me is to evolve on a career level that 
keeps me challenged and adaptive, able to bring new solutions. 
Michael TORNACK – Germany, Junior Consultant at 
Altran Benelux – Belgium - Graduated in 2015
1/ Why did you choose ISAE-SUPAERO and apply for the master 
«Aerospace Mechanics & Avionics»? What were your objectives?
My objectives for the master I chose were clearly a high level master 
in aeronautics with English as teaching language. Additionally 
I focused on masters with a major in structures.  At the end my 
decision was ISAE-SUPAERO for three facts. The first one it seemed 
to be well structured and a clear specialization in aeronautical 
structures was possible, swillecond the fact that the school has a 
very good reputation and third the opportunity to get to know south 
of France with all its aspects (Language, Culture, Country).
2/ According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the 
Master you did?
For my part three main parts are very positive of this master. The 
first is the university’s relation to industry which could be seen in 
lectures by e.g. Airbus Engineers, industrial visits and connection 
to job offers (e.g. internship). Second the school has nice resources 
in terms of software and test facilities. Third the student life with 
its internal character and different clubs (sports, music, etc) gave a 
very good personal life balance.  
3/ Which are your career plans?
At the moment I’m focusing on my first job offer which directly came 
after this Master. Currently I’m employed as a Junior Consultant at 
Altran Benelux (Brussels) with a VIE contract. My work will combine 
Costumer Support with structural calculations (Fatigue and Damage 
Tolerance).
In future I want to be part of aeronautical projects with specialization 
in structural design / calculation.
URBINA Sofia - Spain, PhD student at LAAS-CNRS - 
Graduated in 2013 
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for our master ? What were your 
objectives ?
In Madrid, I had a very theoretical background regarding the 
aerospace domain. I missed both having a more practical 
approach to the aeronautical field and deeper knowledge in space, 
which has always been my passion. These two key points were 
decisive to choose ISAE. The MSc AESS promised to give us both 
theoretic and practical knowledge, which was a real challenge. 
I had full confidence in the school, since its reputation is well 
known worldwide. In addition, coming to France seemed a great 
opportunity to learn another language while improving English 
during lectures. 
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the 
Master you did ?
After graduating, I keep three main strong assets of the Master. The 
first one is its high technical level. The lectures take into account 
both theoretical and practical aspects of each course, which had 
to be finished with a high-quality report. The second one is related 
to the Research Project that has to be performed during two 
semesters. Thanks to it, I discovered my real vocation as researcher 
in the space domain. The last one regards the personal point of 
view. Since ISAE hosts many international students, I had the 
opportunity of interconnecting with other cultures, which enriches 
one’s life.
Which are your career plans ?
I wish to work for Airbus, if possible in flight test engineering.

In my own opinion, the strongest assets of the HE master are : the 
quality of the courses which are taught by teachers from ISAE and 
high specialists from several companies, the partnership with Airbus 
Helicopters and the proximity with the staff, the factory and the 
helicopters, the fact that the master is taught in English.
Which are your career plans ?
As a graduate, I can confirm that following the HE Master at ISAE is 
definitely a huge opportunity for any engineer to improve his skills. 
On my side, the HE Master was a great advantage to be accepted in 
the company where I work nowadays. At the moment, my plan is to 
continue to work in Motorsport, but we never know what could happen 
in the future ! 
Nicolas GENTY-PRISCAL, Application Engineer at 
NTN-SNR, Aerospace Business Unit, Graduated in 2013
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for our master ? What were your 
objectives ?
I choose ISAE school because of the advanced master «Helicopter 
Engineering» which was very unique.  I was and still am fond of 
helicopters and this was a great opportunity to obtain a specific 
degree in helicopter engineering field. My objectives was to be 
hired in a foreign helicopter company by presenting a difference 
compare to other engineers.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the 
Master you did ?
The advanced master «Helicopter Engineering» entirely in English was 
very well thought and organized. More than 15 different subjects from 
basic to some very specific ones only applicable to helicopters. The 
common core syllabus in cooperation with the maintenance master also 
was interesting in order to get strong basis in aeronautical technique 
and a good general culture of this world. Finally, the best asset of 
the master was the 5 weeks training session in Airbus Helicopters 
(Eurocopter at that time) called «Specific Helicopter Training». 
Which are your career plans ?
Currently, I use everyday what I have learnt in the master for my job. 
My goal is to obtain more and more experience in order to improve 
my skills and access to a technical expert job in a aeronautical office 
design. My greatest wish will to become a technical expert in a Bureau 
of Investigation for Civilian Aircraft Safety, but that will be for later! 
Alix ANDRIEU, France, Flight Test engineer Eurocopter, 
Graduated in 2008
During my graduate studies at aeronautical engineer school, my 
dream was to learn about helicopter however all lessons had been 
on airplane so I couldn’t have theoretical lessons on helicopter 
working. So I inquired about possible postgraduate courses in other 
engineering schools or universities and I found this Advanced Master 
in Europe at ISAE.
After 5 years of study I wanted to start my first job but the Master 
was the only way to fill my wish to work in Helicopter industry. So I 
applied for and I could do it.
Thanks to this Master I discovered the helicopter world. This Master 
gathers all fields regarding helicopter. That means materials, 
design, avionic, arming, aerodynamic, vibration, systems, flight 
performances, etc.
One of the main assets of this Master is the involvement of 
Eurocopter. Parts of lectures are taught by engineers, providing me 
with their expertise, giving as well a perception of the working of 
company and different existing jobs.
Now I am working in this leader company of helicopter conception and 
manufacturing. I joined the flight test department after graduation in 
September 2008.
After I have been studying this Master program for one year, I could 
say I feel being a better engineer than without do it».

Processes for Aeronautical Structures 
- ISAE - École des mines d’Albi -
MS AMPAS
Advanced Manufacturing
■ Objectives
The Aeronautical industry market is facing a rapid and 
continuous increase worldwide as shown by the record 
breaking contracts recently signed by both Airbus and Boeing. 
These two industry leaders forecast an increase of close to 5% 
in activity over the next years and estimations indicate that 
the annual increase of large commercial airplanes will induce 
a doubling of the number of aircraft by 2030. Nearly sixty 
percent of the turnover is subcontracted all over the world and 
concerns mostly production and manufacturing activities. As 
a consequence most aeronautical subcontracting companies 
will have to increase their production rates but also to keep 
up to date with technological changes; moving from metallic 
processes toward composite materials processes. Moreover 
the aircraft manufacturers have changed their supply chain 
structure in the last years, and subcontractors are now 
required to manage more complex parts and to take over, on 
their own, the qualification processes.
The Advanced Master course AMPAS, is designed by Mines 
Albi and ISAE with the support of aeronautical industry 
partners. It will give a specialization to master level students 
allowing them to take over high level responsibilities in 
airframe structure manufacturing plants. It is especially well 
suited to students who have followed general studies in 
mechanical engineering, material science or equivalent and 
who would like to gain a major chance to be recruited by 
aeronautical industry.
To reach this goal, AMPAS master students will develop:
 
■ general knowledge of flight dynamics constrains and 
airframe design
 
■ knowledge and understanding of the airframe materials 
and processes and their qualification constrains
 
■ knowledge, understanding and practice of the prevalent 
processes for structural applications with either metallic or 
fiber reinforced thermoset composites materials
 
■ ability to use state of the art simulation tools for definition 
and optimization of metallic sheet forming and RTM/
infusion process 
 
■ knowledge of the aeronautical supply chain structure and 
its communication rules
 
■ understanding of the aeronautic dedicated quality and 
management requirements
 
■ knowledge and practice of lean manufacturing tools
 
■ ability to undertake manufacturing projects in an 
international team environment
 
■ ability to communicate with written reports and by oral 
presentation.

■ Objectives
The global and booming aviation market is characterized by low 
volumes, highly complex products with long lifecycles and high 
values, governed by restrictive regulatory requirements, with 
constant safety concerns and with a huge growth in the aircraft 
maintenance, repair and overhaul business (MRO). MRO plays 
a key role for defence and aviation industry encompassing 
a wide range of complex activities: engine overhaul, heavy 
checks, line maintenance, component maintenance, and major 
airframe modifications. Through regular maintenance, MRO 
ensures the continued airworthiness and operational safety 
of aircraft, and therefore the safety of passengers. Beyond, 
it ensures aircrafts meet the rigorous certification, safety, or 
standards set by international authorities such as ICAO, EASA 
and FAA. 
Today, the aviation industry is facing tremendous challenges. 
To compete, aviation companies in all segments must 
strengthen their ability to increase productivity and production 
rates with products and services that meet customer 
demands, with a focus on continuous critical assessment of 
cost and performance. So, the continued support for MRO is 
an intrinsic part of aeronautical and maintenance manager, 
including service lifecycle management, service organisations, 
configuration management, reducing costs and improving 
service quality.
The objectives of the Master in Aeronautical Maintenance and 
Support are to provide students with up-to-date exposure to 
modern techniques and methods, know-how, regulations and 
standards applied in aviation industry, putting the emphasis on 
life cycle cost management making services more profitable, 
available and reliable.
The master MS AMS aims at providing a wide range of 
knowledge from engineering basics to management of 
maintenance organisation in the respect of international 
regulations within Integrated Logistics Support methods. 
Merging academic teachings, up-to-date ILS and Maintenance 
concepts delivered by experts from industry and authorities, it 
prepares attendees to face, successfully, the competitive and 
fast changing MRO worldwide business.

Airworthiness (ISAE - EnAC - École de  l’Air)
MS ASAA
Aviation Safety Aircraft 
■ Objectives 
Aircraft airworthiness must be considered as a coherent 
process running from the design of the aircraft to the 
monitoring of its technical condition in airline service. The 
Master in Aviation Safety - Aircraft Airworthiness covers 
both the technical aspects of certification and the legal and 
economic implications. This course has been designed to 
give future managers a broad understanding of the issues 
and priorities which, as far as aeronautical construction is 
concerned, have an international dimension.
Air transport deregulation and the development of a global 
economy necessarily imply an increase in vigilance on behalf 
of both the regulatory authorities and the industry. Progress 
regarding safety has been constant. During the last 30 years, 
the accident rate per flight hour has been reduced by a factor 
of 10. This is becoming insufficient due to the considerable 
increase in traffic. Current trends should encourage us to 
make even more improvements, and this necessarily involves 
trainings. The Master in Aviation Safety Aircraft Airworthiness 
will provide future operators with the key to success in times 
to come.

Why did you choose ISAE and apply for the advanced master
«Aviation Safety Aircraft Airworthiness”? What were your 
objectives?
Aircraft worthiness is the discipline to judge the complete structural 
validity and safety. It requires abundant knowledge and technical 
experience to evaluate an aerial vehicle’s fitness to work, not only 
according to the theorized plan, but also according to indefinite 
practically probable situations. 
After working for 4 years in aircraft maintenance domain, I was 
amazed to see how much aircraft  manufacturers are involved in 
keeping the aircraft safe in operation even after the aircraft is 
operated by its operator. I came to a realization that enhancing 
my design and technical skills with depth knowledge of safety and 
airworthiness will provide me an edge; this is why I decided to 
advance my education in this field by pursuing Advanced Masters 
in Aviation Safety and Aircraft Airworthiness at ISAE-SUPERO & 
ENAC.
The fact that master is shared by ISAE, ENAC and Ecole de l’Air 
which are the most esteemed aeronautical universities was one 
of the other reasons. They are very well established and the fact 
that they are located in Toulouse at the epicenter of the aerospace 
industry gives them a superior advantage in terms of proximity and 
providing strong industry links.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the 
Master you did?
The strongest asset of this Advanced Masters is its pragmatic 
approach. The professors who gave us the lectures on a wide range 
of technical, regulatory and operational topics were the people 
directly from the industry who could share the firsthand experience 
after years of working on the specified domain.
Secondly, the enriching international environment with students 
coming from all over the world opens a plethora of knowledge 
and opportunities which develops an individual personally and 
professionally. 
Which are your career plans ?
After successfully completing my internship at ATR, I was offered 
a position of Consultant Engineer by Altran France to continue my 
activity at ATR. Working with a manufacturer has an advantage of 
its own; it opens up the door to different domains which further 
enhances the skills and knowledge of an individual. I would like to 
continue my activity and gain expertise in the different fields and 
gain significant knowledge working with different manufacturers, 
operators and MROs. Long term goals; I would love to have a MRO 
of my own. But for that, there is a long way to go!

and technical expert” for the SESAR program at IATA 
- Belgium, Graduated in 2014.
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for the advanced master 
«Aviation Safety Aircraft Airworthiness”? What were your 
objectives?
This particular Master has the advantage of combining courses at 
ISAE and ENAC universities. Obtaining a degree from those two 
well-known Toulouse universities was a real challenge for me, as 
I left school 25 years ago. I wanted to combine my background of 
airlines Captain and operational/ technical expert for international 
organisations with the strong theoretical and practical training given 
at those universities.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of 
the Master you did?
The scope of the Master is very wide: Aircraft systems, performance, 
Safety, Human factors and all airworthiness aspects are explained 
by professionals. An internship period of 6 months is also planned: it 
gives the opportunity to work for major companies based in Toulouse.
Which are your career plans ?
I am waiting for opportunities in an international organisation like

Alexandre VANSTEENE, Network & telecommunication 
engineer at Airbus Defence and Space,
Graduated in 2014
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for the advanced master 
«Space Communication Systems»
Before joining the Space Communication Systems advanced master, 
I graduated from a French engineering school (Computer Science 
major). I decided to pursue a Master to combine two passions 
(computer science and aerospatial/aeronautics).  Choosing the 
SCS Master has been quite a natural choice for two reasons: the 
reputation of ISAE and the perfect match between the knowledge I 
acquired during my curriculum and the one I wanted to gain. 
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the 
Master you did?
The Space Communication Systems advanced master offers 
several advantages. The program is divided in two distinct parts 
-an academic semester and an internship- allowing to provide both 
theoretical and practical knowledge. The academic semester allows 
to get a deep understanding of how a space communication system 
works. High quality courses are taught both by reknown academic 
professors and experts from the industry (immerse into industry 
practice). Numerous tutorials and long projects constitute a good 
complement to theoretical knowledge by allowing to manipulate 
and use state of the art satcom equipments. The advanced master 
staff is deeply involved to make the program work at its best. To 
illustrate this point, two visits have been organized (satellite 
teleport and satellite assembly facilities) giving a sense to what is 
theoretically studied all the year long.
Which are your career plans ?
I found a job in the satcom field immediately after my end of 
studies internship carried out at Thales Alenia Space. The position 
I have matches accurately with the SCS Master subject. I work 
for a French satellite communication earth stations integrator. I 
am in charge of designing & sizing earth stations used for satcom 
transmission systems. The SCS Master was absolutely required 
in term of knowledge to hold this position. I am applying what I 
learned during the SCS year almost every days. Technologies in 
the satcom world evolve very fast and I think that there is a lot of 
potential for the future!
Chunbang WU, China, Engineer, CAST, 
Graduated in 2011
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for our master ? What 
were your objectives ?
ISAE is well known in aeronautic and areospace field all over 
the world. It is CAST (China academy of space technology) 
recommends me choosing this school and applying for Advanced 
Master. My objectives were to improve my basic theory in Space 
Communication System and to enhance the tighten friendship with 
European company.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of 
the Master you did ?
In my study period, the deepest impression is that teachers 
have broad and deep knowledge, strong system concept and 
accurate logic, such as Professor Michel Bousquet. He provided 
many chances to visit the well-known aerospace company and 
communicate with the experts.  
Which are your career plans ? 
After going back to China, I will continue my work in CAST. I will 
use my knowledge learned from ISAE to the aerospace program of 
China. I will become a general designer of satellite system.  
Daniel Philip VENMANI, India, Graduated in 2010
France, a land of Fashion and food, the land of TGV, is superior in 
its technology also. And that is the prime reason I opted for France 
as a destination to do my Masters Studies. France, being one of the 
leaders in wireless communications with Satellite Communications 
and Telecommunications, bearing major concerns like the Airbus 
Group, Thales attracted me to pursue my Masters in Space 
Communication Systems. 
And, to its credit, ISAE is the best place to begin a career in 
communications, where in numerous research works are being 
carried out in domains like Ad-Hoc networks, Wireless Networks, 
Resource Allocation for satellite links, Radio engineering for 
satellite systems etc.  
ISAE, best known for its exclusive training for engineers in the 
field of Aeronautical Engineering, is no way inferior for Satellite 
communications as well. Best professors like Marie Laure 
Boucheret, Michel Bousquet, Laurent Franck are all known for 
excellent academic and research accomplishments in their 
respective field. World class Labs that are opened throughout the 
day, easy access to libraries and above all always-smiling and most 
willingly helpful staff will make the stay more pleasant. 
In short, I could conclude that «ISAE- Not so foreign!» to me, as 
I have all my motherland feelings inherited in it while studying 
there! Today, I find myself as a Doctoral Candidate with Orange 
Labs, thanks to ISAE!

Jitendra SINGH, India, 2015-2016 student 
1/ Why did you choose ISAE and apply for the advanced  master 
«TAS Aero-FTE» ? What were your objectives ? 
I have worked in aerospace industry for over 15 years in India, 
Europe and USA. I had started my career in Indian Defence 
Organisation, and was also the Program Manager of India’s first 
Regional Jet program (NCAD).  In recent years, I was deployed to 
Military Flight Test environment at Indian Air Force Test squadrons.  
Therefore, I came to study at ISAE SUPAERO to develop my 
expertise in the area of Flight testing & certification particularly 
of Civil aircraft.  I would like to thank Mr Philippe Galaup for 
recommending me the FTE course; his advice was very well timed 
and helped me make a decision to come to the school.  About 10 
years ago, I also graduated Masters of Aerospace Engineering from 
Delft University of Technology (Netherlands), and did internship at 
ETH Zurich Switzerland. 
2/ According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the 
Master you did ? 
The rigorous program was imparted by the Test Pilots, Flight Test 
Engineers and Industry Experts from Airbus/Dassault/EPNER/DGA 
CEV/ONERA/Airbus Helicopters.  As an FTE, we flew 4 types of 
aircraft at 3 different airfields with 4 Pilots.  We performed various 
Flight tests Experiments that included Airspeed calibration, Aircraft 
performance, Handling qualities, Acceptance and Evaluation flight.
Apart from the flight experiments, the ground courses were of high 
scientific caliber and demanded academic excellence; which was 
aimed to bring out the best in us.  Thanks to Prof Eric Poquillion (the 
Head of FTE ) for his rich expertise in Flight testing and certification, 
who himself is a graduate from EPNER (French Test Pilots School).
I am grateful to Supaero that I have an exciting stage at CFM LEAP 
Flight Test Team to support the flight test campaign of Airbus A320 
NEO program at its flight test center in Toulouse.
My experience wouldn’t be complete if I don’t  mention about the 
the impressive Sports facilities and multitude of clubs at Supaero. I 
particularly enjoyed my time at Football, Swimming, and Ping-Pong 
club
3/ Which are your career plans ?
My career plan is to continue to build my expertise in the field of 
flight testing and contribute to the development and testing of 
efficient technologies for the field of aviation. I am particularly 
interested to work in the field of civil / business aviation.
Samuel BARCHECHATH, France, Planning test for 
development aircrafts at Airbus flight test centre, 
Graduated in 2014 
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for the advanced 
master?
Choosing ISAE was clear. Since 1909, the school is deeply linked 
to the history of aeronautics, very strong in Toulouse and has 
contributed to the global aviation history. All around the world, 
ISAE is one of the best aerospace references for its high level and 
quality of teaching and I knew that I could be fully confident on the 
rich and leading edge technology of this Advanced Master, taught 
for more than 30 years.
But mainly, subjects of this Advanced Master fit with my interests 
and my professional expectations and especially FTE option has 
confirmed my choice.
What  were your objectives ?
On the one hand, as I already have an aeronautic experience in 
flight simulation domain, I wanted to direct my professional activity 
towards a more practical and test aspect.
On the other hand, it was important for me to cement between 
professional knowledge already acquired, to strengthen and 
expand my skills in subjects such as mainly aerodynamics, handling 
qualities and flight test techniques.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of 
the Master you did ?
Teaching quality, availability and support of teachers as well as 
experts and specialists from industry can allow accentuating my 
theoretical knowledge and being aware of the reality of aeronautic 
industrial world for a better understanding of aircraft manufacturer 
difficulties. 
More for FTE training, the team spirit was also a strong and 
necessary point, brought by Eric Poquillon and also by our two 
pilots.
Which are your career plans?
I have worked for 13 years on many kinds of flight simulator platforms. 
This provides me knowledge and experience on this important part of 
an aircraft development cycle. Now, I foresee to access to a position 
that requires working on theoretical topics and their practical validation 
on aircraft, in narrow collaboration with data analysis, flight test or in 
airline.   
Jeanne PLANTINET, France, currently working for the 
Customer Services of Airbus in Toulouse, within the 
Engineering Support team specialized in Cabin systems 
& facilities, Graduated in 2013
«First of all, my interest for aeronautics came very soon during my 
training at ICAM Nantes where I studied General Engineering. This is 
the reason why I chose to do all of my internships in this domain. Once 
graduated from ICAM, I really wanted to be specialized in aeronautics, 
as I was targeting this domain for my professional career. My main 
objectives were to acquire a very thorough knowledge of aeronautical 
engineering and to be in contact with professionals from this domain. 
Hence, by the prestige of this school and the diversity of their 
specialized masters, ISAE rapidly became my first choice. 
I thus integrated the specialized master TAS Aero Eng, which offers 
a very complete training, as we had courses in all the aspects of the 
aeronautical domain (Structures, Propulsion, Flight controls, Avionics, 
Maintenance,  etc.). Moreover, we had the opportunity to develop 
relationships with professionals from Airbus, Dassault, Latécoère, etc. 
On a general point of view, studying in ISAE also enables me to be 
part of an important network of aeronautical engineers, which is very 
rewarding for an engineer career. 
As for my professional objectives, I firstly want to work in technical 
jobs in order to acquire a good background, and then after several years 
orientate my career to manager positions with more responsibilities. 
Moreover, I really appreciate to work for a big aircraft manufacturer as 
Airbus, which offers a lot of opportunities».

Ludovic FRAUMAR,  “Mechanical Systems Engineer » at Arianespace, France,  graduated in 2015 
1/ Why did you choose ISAE and apply for the advanced master «Aerospace project Management» ? What were your objectives ? 
I decided to apply for this advanced master because it offers a comprehensive training, through 4 main complementary modules.
My objectives were, first to have strong theoretical knowledge about project management, which was a natural complement to my 
engineering degree (master of science). Then, I wanted to build a real network, by studying in a cosmopolite environment and in three of 
the best European engineering schools. But most of all, this year was for me the opportunity to adjust and prepare my professional project.
2/ According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the advanced Master you did ? 
I think this advanced master has 4 main strengths: the quality and excellence of the lectures that fit the current aerospace environment, the 
actual support of the administration team, the diversity of the trainees in terms of diploma, experience, age or nationality, and, last but not 
least, the living environment, including the opportunity to be part of the student and associative life like I was at SUPAERO Space Section.
3/ Which are your career plans ?
I have started my career in an operational and technical job, as a mechanical systems engineer. I believe that, before bearing some 
managerial responsibilities, it is important for me to know more the launch campaign activities. I will be able after few years to apply for 
a project management responsibility. Eventually, I would like to create my own structure in order to share with others what I have learnt, 
in a teaching or coaching activity.
Wichaya CADENE, “A350-Powerplant Recurring Cost Manager” at Airbus, Thailand, graduated in 2012
I’ve heard a reputation that ISAE is the best aeronautic school in France and students who are graduated from this school are «cream of the 
cream». Graduating from this school is a preliminary guarantee in your capability before moving to professional career. This makes me believe 
that diploma from ISAE will strengthen my profile and makes my CV more interesting among thousands of candidates.My goal is to get a job 
in aerospace business but I’ve experience in automobile. I think advanced master in Aerospace Project Management is a key to open a door 
that I can walk straight into Aeronautic industrial businesses and knowledge in project management can be applied in all kinds of businesses.

Guoliang SUN, China, Graduated in 2012
I have been working in AVIC as a Radar System Engineer for 6 
years. My reasons for applying to the SEN Advanced Master were 
to have a systematic view of complex system development and also 
to practise my experiences.
The strengths of SEN are:
-  first the knowledge of Systems Engineering. I get a lot of 
knowledge for the system development, system design, 
verification and so on. I also increase my capability for analysing 
and solving problems, especially complex problems.
-  then the quality of the education. The professors are very 
professional. There are professors from industry. So they can 
give us practical experiments about their job.
-  last but not least, the international atmosphere. We can be 
involved in an international team during the SEN master program.
My plan for the future is to continue the Radar System Engineer 
(at AVIC) with the new skills that I gained in ISAE in the Systems 
Engineering master.

CPT Luca S. Parmitano, Air Force Italia, Graduated in 2009, selected by ESA
I was selected by my government for this advanced master which is related to the EPNER test pilot school course. As the master is still 
taught in French, I wish give advice future students to learn French, it will help in learning the French culture, which in turn will help 
them to better understand the courses, even when they are in English. Plus, knowing the language will help them enjoy the beautiful city. 
Regarding my career, let’s say the master helped me get my future job: in September 2009, I joined the European Space Agency to start 
astronaut training».
American Officer, Graduated in 2011
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for our master ? What were your objectives ?
I came to ISAE as part of the MSIEVEX, associated with EPNER. My objectives were to work on mathematics, aviation, and aeronautical engineering 
subjects in French, in order to expand my knowledge of French engineering practice and begin my training as a Flight Test Engineer.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of the Master you did ?
The greatest strength of the MSIEVEX program for me was the wealth of expertise available through our instructors and administrators, even in 
a short course like ours (only two months, during the summer). I am grateful that so many talented and knowledgeable professors dedicate their 
summer weeks to working with the MSIEVEX students. I also appreciate the inclusion of our Alliance professor and the French language course, 
because as a foreign student, having an excellent French teacher to complement the purely technical subjects was imperative.
I will know more about the specific strengths of the ISAE MSIEVEX program working together with the Program A stage at EPNER after I have 
spent more time at EPNER!
Which are your career plans ?
I will return to the United States in September 2012 to work as a Flight Test Engineer (Rotary-Wing specialty).  I will spend at least three years in 
a FTE-RW job, and then I will build on that experience as an engineer and a field grade officer in the US Air Force.

Virginie VERRIERE, France, France, Navigability and 
process Engineer at Airbus, Graduated in 2014
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for the advanced  master 
«Structures Aéronautiques et Spatiales» ? What were your 
objectives?
I choose ISAE because I wanted to integrate a school that was already 
well implemented in the industrial aeronautical environment; I wanted 
to have a strong first contact with industrial and scientific actors of 
the aeronautic and space domain. With my background in materials 
physics, I wished to have a strong training in structures, with the most 
used tools and methods in these fields, the roadmap and the state of 
the art of the specialties of aeronautics and space.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of 
the Master you did ?
According my experience, the main assets of the Master are, first the 
complete and global training of all the disciplines that are studied: 
it gives us a strong basis to adapt and success at all industrial and 
academic subjects proposed in the field of structures. The second asset 
is the fields where are the experts from, who are introduced to us 
and taught their disciplines: they are from industrial and/or academic 
environments, or even research laboratories. 
Which are your career plans ?
After an internship at CNES, I had the opportunity to integrate Airbus 
for a mission in airworthiness certification processes: it is the chance 
for me to know aeronautic environment in details, its particularities, its 
constraints and its roadmap. I would like then going on about materials 
and structures fields, particularly in research and development for that 
I have already skills and 5-year-background. 
Pierre GAMBIER, France, Aircraft Stress Solution 
engineer at Airbus, Graduated in 2011
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for our master ? What were 
your objectives ?
My previous school was a general engineering school. Although it 
gave me a good overview of the engineering world, it left me a taste of 
unaccomplishment in the field I liked : structure.
I came out of my previous engineering degree with a pretty good 
file and recommendations, so I applied for the master’s degrees at 
ISAE with the objectives of acquiring more technical and specialised 
knowledge on aerospace structure and gain a recognise expertise in 
this field.
According to your experience, which are the strong assets of 
the Master you did ?
The first strongest asset of the SAS master is the uniqueness and 
quality of the teaching and the teachers. We had access to the 
knowledge of former or current renown industrial specialists in each 
topic we studied, turning each lesson into a very special moment 
where we could learn from the very best !!
The second strongest asset of the SAS master and of all the ISAE 
master’s is the renown of the school. Having ISAE on a resume really 
makes a difference in the recruitment process, and the expertise we 
gain during the formation is really recognised by the recruiters
Which are your career plans ?
Working in Airbus in the Structure engineering field. Currently I’m starting 
to work as an Aircraft Stress Solution Engineer for the A350 XWB 
program, supporting the use of new Finite Element Model softwares.

Systèmes 
d’Equilibrage Axial de turbopompes à hydrogène liquide 
chez SNECMA VERNON, diplômé en 2014
Pourquoi avez-vous choisi de suivre le Mastère Spécialisé® 
«Systèmes de Propulsion Aérospatiale» proposé par l’ISAE ?
Ayant initialement suivi une formation d’ingénieur en Mécanique des 
fluides et ayant un goût très prononcé pour les moteurs d’avions et 
les turbomachines en particulier, j’ai décidé de suivre le MS Systèmes 
de Propulsion Aérospatiales afin de compléter et perfectionner mes 
connaissances sur ce domaine. De plus, c’était une opportunité pour moi 
de suivre une formation technique de qualité à l’ISAE, une des meilleures 
écoles de France dans le secteur Aéronautique et Aérospatial. Soucieux 
d’appréhender en profondeur le fonctionnement et la conception des 
moteurs d’avion ou de fusée pour travailler dans de grands groupes 
aéronautiques, ce MS m’a permis de monter en compétences sur cette 
thématique et il m’a fait découvrir une large palette de métiers entrant en 
jeu dans la conception d’un moteur.
Selon vous, quels sont les points forts du programme que 
vous avez suivi ?
- Qualité des enseignements : réelle volonté de la part des intervenants 
de faire découvrir leur passion à des étudiants curieux et intéressés. 
J’ai vraiment pu voir que les intervenants avaient à cœur de faire 
découvrir leurs univers et les problématiques industrielles actuelles 
aux étudiants
- Pluridisciplinarité : beaucoup de disciplines sont abordées dans la 
formation, offrant une vision d’ensemble des métiers intervenant dans 
la conception et le fonctionnement d’un système propulsif
- Bi – dimensionnalité : la formation offre aux étudiants une vision 
industrielle mais aussi de recherche en laboratoire qu’il est important 
d’avoir à l’esprit dans ce secteur
- Liberté : la formation fait preuve d’une certaine souplesse dans le 
choix des projets scolaires encadrés laissant certains degrés de liberté 
aux étudiants qui peuvent ainsi aborder des thématiques plus ciblées 
sur leurs projets professionnels ou selon leur curiosité
Aujourd’hui, quels sont vos projets professionnels?
Aujourd’hui, je travaille en tant que concepteur de turbopompes dans les 
turbomachines spatiales et j’envisage de conforter mes connaissances et 
ma technique dans ce domaine. Mon département m’offre la possibilité 
de ne pas rester cantonné à l’aspect conception des turbopompes et 
j’aurais certainement l’occasion d’aborder d’autres problématiques 
liées à ces différents organes. L’aspect détermination des performances 
des moteurs civils m’a toujours intéressé et j’envisage pourquoi pas 
de m’orienter un jour vers des problématiques d’avant-projet dans ce 
domaine-là. 
Guillaume GARSON, France, ingénieur thermodynamicien 
aux avant-projets chez SAFRAN SNECMA, diplômé en 2013
Pourquoi avez-vous choisi de suivre le Mastère Spécialisé® 
«Systèmes de Propulsion Aérospatiale» proposé par l’ISAE ?
J’ai choisi d’effectuer le MS SPA après avoir eu un parcours 
plutôt atypique. J’ai débuté mes études supérieures avec un 
DUT Génie Thermique et Energie à l’IUT de Marne-la-Vallée. J’ai 
souhaité poursuivre avec une formation d’Ingénieur Généraliste 
en alternance (SAFRAN SNECMA) au sein du CESI de Paris. Enfin, 
souhaitant me spécialiser et acquérir de solides connaissances 
techniques dans le domaine de l’aéronautique et plus spécialement 
la propulsion, j’ai décidé d’effectuer le MS SPA.
Aujourd’hui, je ne regrette absolument pas mes choix et principalement 
celui d’avoir fait le MS SPA qui m’a propulsé dans la vie active avec une 
aisance étonnante. En effet, lors de la recherche de stage il m’a fallu 
refuser de nombreuses offres qui m’étaient proposées. De plus, peu de 
de temps après avoir débuté mon stage au sein de SAFRAN SNECMA, 
il m’a été proposé un poste et j’ai pu signer une promesse d’embauche.
Selon vous, quels sont les points forts du programme que 
vous avez suivi ?
Indiscutablement, l’enseignement technique qui nous a été fourni a 
été de très grande qualité. Les bureaux d’études proposés permettent 
directement d’appliquer l’enseignement reçu et traitent tous de 
problématiques industrielles.
Le cadre de l’ISAE où est dispensé le MS SPA est également à prendre 
en compte. Vous évoluez pleinement dans environnement très agréable 
et au sein d’une ville jeune et dynamique.  
Aujourd’hui, quels sont vos projets professionnels?
Je souhaiterais parcourir le plus possible le cycle de vie d’un moteur. 
Je vais, à l’issu de mon stage, débuter ma carrière en tant qu’ingénieur 
thermodynamicien aux avant-projets. Après quelques années, je pense 
me diriger vers des activités liées aux essais moteur. Par la suite, je 
souhaiterais rejoindre le support technique au client afin de répondre à 
des problématiques de mises en services et de suivi des flottes. Enfin, à 
plus long terme, intégrer progressivement des activités de management 
d’équipe.
Thomas LAMBOT, France, ingénieur à la NASA, diplômé 
en 2012
Pourquoi avez-vous choisi de suivre le Mastère Spécialisé® 
«Systèmes de Propulsion Aérospatiale» proposé par l’ISAE ?
J’ai depuis toujours été passionné par le domaine aérospatial. Que ce 
soit avions, hélicoptères ou fusées. Dès que quelque chose volait, c’est 
tout ce qu’il fallait pour attirer mon attention.
Après avoir fini mes études d’ingénieur en Belgique, je voulais 
me spécialiser dans un domaine qui m’a toujours tenu à cœur : la 
propulsion. Ce domaine étant multidisciplinaire, les formations qui 
lui sont consacrées essentiellement ne sont pas très nombreuses. En 
discutant avec des connaissances j’ai appris que l’ISAE, dont la qualité 
d’enseignement dans le secteur aérospatial n’est plus à démontrer, 
offrait exactement ce que je cherchais. J’ai sauté sur l’occasion, ai 
soumis ma candidature et ai été accepté !
Selon vous, quels sont les points forts du programme que 
vous avez suivi ?
Le mastère SPA a l’avantage d’avoir des professeurs experts dans leur 
discipline, venant du monde de la recherche ou d’entreprises. Tout ce 
que l’on apprend ou revoit est directement appliqué au secteur de la 
propulsion.
Un autre point fort est les différents bureaux d’études : que ce soit pour 
le design d’un moteur de fusée, l’étude de résultats de simulation CFD 
sur un aubage de turbine ou le travail sur un banc d’essai moteur.
Finalement, un des plus grands atouts du mastère est son stage en 
entreprise qui, dans pas mal de cas, débouche directement sur un job.
Aujourd’hui, quels sont vos projets professionnels?
Après mon stage à NASA Ames sur le projet «Millimeter-wave Thermal 
Launch System» (un système expérimental de propulsion de fusée 
étudié là-bas), j’ai reçu une proposition pour rester travailler sur ce 
projet ou je développe maintenant un prototype qui devrait décoller 
d’ici un an. Dans le futur, je souhaiterais rejoindre une des nombreuses 
compagnies émergentes du secteur spatial privé, pour développer les 
moteurs fusée de demain.

Quentin BROSSEAU, France, étudiant 2014-2015, en 
stage au CNES
Pourquoi avez-vous postulé au Mastère Spécialisé® «Électronique et 
Télécommunications Aérospatiales» ? Quels étaient vos objectifs ?
J’ai postulé en MS car je souhaitais pouvoir envisager une carrière 
dans les domaines de l’aéronautique/spatial. Or je n’avais aucune 
compétence dans ces derniers. Mes objectifs étaient donc d’obtenir 
les éléments manquant afin d’acquérir les compétences adéquates 
et donc pouvoir envisager (en tout cas un peu plus qu’auparavant) 
cette carrière.
Cette année m’a aussi permis de développer mon réseau 
professionnel en bénéficiant des rencontres organisées par l’école, 
mais aussi des conseils des professeurs. J’ai également pu profiter 
de la proximité de cette dernière avec les entreprises du domaine 
(j’habitais La Ciotat avant ce qui n’arrangeait pas les choses).
Selon-vous, quels sont les points forts de ce programme ?
Nous sommes entourés de personnes ayant une expérience forte 
dans le domaine. Les relations école-entreprises nous permettent 
en général de trouver un stage assez facilement dans le domaine, 
ce qui est un réel tremplin.
Quels sont vos projets professionnels?
J’espère pouvoir réussir une carrière dans le spatial et être 
embaucher chez un des grands du spatial.
Actuellement je suis en stage au CNES, je travaille sur le projet 
REGINA qui consiste à mettre en place un réseau mondial de 
station GNSS qui réceptionnent les signaux des différentes 
constellations de satellites afin de les mettre à disposition de 
la communauté scientifique. Mon sujet consiste tout d’abord à 
identifier les différentes solutions possibles pour vérifier l’intégrité 
des données transmises (il a fallu définir des critères de fiabilité et 
contacter différents organismes quant aux solutions existantes/à 
venir puis les tester).
Enfin la seconde partie consiste à réfléchir sur l’optimisation de 
l’acheminement des flux jusqu’au CNES à Toulouse de tous les 
points de vue (latence, disponibilité, etc…).
Pauline Dixon, Great Britain, Graduated in 2012
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for the advanced master

and also because of the quality of its teaching. I chose the MS 
«Electronique et télécommunications aérospatiales» as this 
Advanced Master matched most closely my interests, and the fact 
it is mostly taught in French appealed to me as French is not my 
mother tongue and I wanted to improve my technical French.
According to your experience, which are the strengths of the master 
you did ? 
This Master covers a broad spectrum of subjects, with a good mix of 
lectures and practical work. The quality of the teaching is very high, 
with a significant percentage of the lecturers being professionals 
working in the industry who communicate not only the state-of-the-
art but also their passion for their respective fields.
Which are your career plans ?
I am currently applying for posts in the signal processing discipline, 
confident that the skills I have acquired this year, both through the 
taught courses and the placement in industry, will enable me to 
further my career in the aerospace industry.

Marie Mainguy, France, diplômée 2014, consultante 
chez Solucom en architecture des systèmes 
d’information
Pourquoi avez-vous postulé au Mastère Spécialisé® 
«Mangement de Grands Projets» ? Quels étaient vos objectifs ?
J’ai postulé au mastère MGP pour approfondir les vagues notions 
de management abordées en école d’ingénieur. Lors de mon stage 
de fin d’étude, j’étais développeuse. Mais c’est le travail de mon 
maître de stage qui me paraissait le plus passionnant. Il pilotait de 
grands projets de transformation de système d’information. Mon 
objectif lors de mon entrée dans le mastère était d’acquérir les 
connaissances nécessaires au pilotage de projet de transformation 
de SI, le coeur de la majorité des entreprises.   
Selon-vous, quels sont les points forts de ce programme ?
Le premier point fort est la non spécialisation du mastère dans un type 
de projet. Cela laisse le champs libre à tout changement d’orientation 
en terme de domaine. De plus, cela permet de rencontrer des profils 
d’étudiants très divers. C’est un enrichissement d’un point de vue 
personnel et professionnel.
Le second est la partie «professionnalisante» du mastère. Les 
missions en entreprise et le projet de création de start-up rapprochent 
les étudiants de la vie professionnelle qui les attend. Grâce aux 
missions j’ai pu découvrir le monde du conseil et y avoir une 
première expérience qui m’a ouvert les portes d’autres cabinets. De 
plus, de nombreux intervenants sont des professionnels et non des 
professeurs qui partagent leurs expériences et leur vécu sur le terrain. 
Quels sont vos projets professionnels ?
Je suis actuellement consultante chez Solucom en architecture des 
systèmes d’information. Mon projet est de continuer dans la voie 
du conseil où je suis confrontée à de nombreux projets souvent 
complexes et surtout très différents les uns des autres.

Stephen GICHUKI - Airworthiness Inspector - Kenya 
Civil Aviation Authority
«The training course is one of a kind summarized review of 
helicopter engineering for a practicing aeronautical engineer or 
mature engineering student. The training course especially benefits 
from the great wealth of experience of the specialist facilitators 
from Airbus Helicopters, diversity of the participants and  the on-
site plant visits. I found the ISAE- Helicopter Engineering Certificate 
course valuable for continuous professional development because 
in a short period I was able to recap on helicopter engineering 
principles, relevant EASA/ FAA certification regulations and various 
technical developments influencing the global helicopter industry.
 
As an Airworthiness Inspector working for Kenya Civil Aviation 
Authority, I will use the knowledge gained in developing suitable 
strategies for the effective safety oversight of helicopter 
maintenance and operations. Further, the insight I acquired during 
the training will be very useful guidance both the governmental 
and civilian entities in the implementation of their helicopter 
related activities/ projects.»

“The Certificate is efficient timewise and budgetwise speaking. 
The one-month timeframe is fit for those who have no need in 
taking a full one-year break for studies with the incurring cost. The 
curriculum also provides technical knowledge from insiders. After 
all UAVs are, and will still be, a hot topic, so it’s best to keep up-
to-date with the current trend. Even though some sessions can go 
deep into specific topics, the cursus do provide a good systems 
view knowledge of UAV systems as a whole.
 Overall, this compact fast-paced curriculum helped me steer my 
career into the field of embedded air systems. The training was 
a great experience, especially the third part at the French Air 
Force academy. It’s not only about technical knowledge but also 
networking.

the specificities of a very particular business. After two years of 
practical experience in the maintenance department of Comfort 
Jet Services, I decided to attend one academic semester at ISAE-
SUPAERO to acquire high theoretical knowledge in aeronautical 
maintenance management, and it happened to be a great decision. 
The Advanced Certificate gave me a broad view of all theoretical

Graduated in 2011
Why did you choose ISAE and apply for our master ? 
What were your objectives ?
ISAE is well known in areonutic and areospace field all over 
the world. It is CAST (China academy of space technology) 
recommends me choosing this school and applying for 
Advanced Master. My objectives were to improve my basic 
theory in Space Communication System and to enhance the 
tighten friendship with European company.
According to your experience, which are the strong 
assets of the Master you did ?
In my study period, the deepest impression is that teachers 
have broad and profund knowledge, strong system concept 
and accurate logic, such as Professor Michel Bousquet. He 
provided many chances to visit the well-known areospace 
company and communicate with the experts.  
Which are your career plans ? 
After going back to China, I will continue my work in CAST. I 
will use my knowledge learned from ISAE to the areospace 
program of China. I will become a general designer of satellite 
system.  
VENMANI Daniel Philip, India, Graduated in 2010
France, a land of Fashion and food, the land of TGV, is superior 
in its technology also. And that is the prime reason I opted 
for France as a destination to do my Masters Studies. France, 
being one of the leaders in wireless communications with 
Satellite Communications and Telecommunications, bearing 
major concerns like the EADS, Thales attracted me to pursue 
my Masters in Space Communication Systems. 
And, to its credit, ISAE is the best place to begin a career 
in communications, where in numerous research works are 
being carried out in domains like Ad-Hoc networks, Wireless 
Networks, Resource Allocation for satellite links, Radio 
engineering for satellite systems etc.  
ISAE, best known for its exclusive training for engineers in 
the field of Aeronautical Engineering, is no way inferior for 
Satellite communications as well. Best professors like Marie 
Laure Boucheret, Michel Bousquet, Laurent Franck are all 
known for excellent academic and research accomplishments 
in their respective field. World class Labs that are opened 
throughout the day, easy access to libraries and above all 
always-smiling and most willingly helpful staff will make the 
stay more pleasant. 
In short, I could conclude that «ISAE- Not so foreign!» to 
me, as I have all my motherland feelings inherited in it while 
studying there! Today, I find myself as a Doctoral Candidate 
with Orange Labs, thanks to ISAE!

 Think out of the box 
Create value
Originally founded by the Toulouse Chamber of Commerce, Toulouse Business 
School (TBS) took off in 1903. Same year, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky deduced the 
Basic Rocket Equation(1) and the Wright Brothers (Orville and Wilbur) invented 
and built the world’s first successful airplane, and made the first controlled, 
powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight(2).
Think & create are two sides of TBS core mission: building practical skills for the 
business world of today and tomorrow. 
Today considered as one of the best French “Grandes Écoles”, TBS is part of 
a prestigious group of international business schools that hold the “triple crown” 
of accreditation - EQUIS (since 2001), AMBA (since 2002), and AACSB (since 2003). 
This accomplishment has been achieved by only 2% of business schools in the 
world. 
Toulouse is the second biggest French University research metropolis only to Paris, 
one of the leading international centers for:
- aerospace research (CNES, Onera, Engineering Schools, Aerospace Valley), 
- development and production of civil aircraft (Airbus and ATR), 
-  earth observation and satellite systems (Airbus Defence & Space and Thales 
Alenia Space).
At the heart of a world-class aerospace complex located in this exceptional 
industrial, academic and research environment, Toulouse Business School shares 
its management expertise with the Aerospace world.
The Aerospace MBA program makes a valuable contribution to the Aerospace 
ecosystem where professionals, academics, researchers and students come 
together to share knowledge and experience and build a global network.
“Nowhere else in the world could you find such a large number of origins and 
cultures and so many manufacturers, airlines, service companies, electronics 
businesses and research organizations, all connected in some way to the aerospace 
sector. That’s why we attract high-caliber students from all over the world eager 
to join the program”.

After a 3-day team building and induction seminar, the curriculum starts 
by providing participants with a broad coverage of the main fundamental 
strategic and functional areas in management taught mainly by the 
permanent faculty of Toulouse Business School, namely:
• Strategy and Core Business
•  Corporate Finance and Financial Accounting 
• Economics and Sustainable Development
• Operations Strategy and Management
• Human Capital and Leadership Development
• Marketing and Sales
Then, the program adopts a complete process approach that covers 
the key management topics that cut across different functions in the 
aerospace sector.
These process workshops, instructed by highly qualified professionals 
from the Aerospace industry and services, are:
• Managing Alliances and Partnerships
• Change Management
• Managing Complex Projects
• Insurance, Hedging and Risk Management
• Management Accounting and Performance Monitoring
• Knowledge and Competence Management
• Supply Chain Management
• Legal Environment and Ethics
The combination of these two approaches (functional and process) 
forms a matrix structure that corresponds to the typical organizational 
structure that is common in the Aerospace sector.
Beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge and technical skills, 
the curriculum is designed to put theory into practice by focusing on 
the personal development of participants through such competencies 
as decision making, team work, self-leadership, leadership skills, 
entrepreneurial potential, negotiation, communication and presentation 
skills.
Then elective courses on Aerospace Sub Sectors such as Civil Aircraft 
and Engines, Airlines, Airport, Defence and Space are proposed.
The aim of these electives is to further broaden participants’ knowledge, 
such that they will be able to integrate into their decision-making processes, 
management problems encountered in specific aerospace sub sectors. 
Finally, the program ends with a full time 4 month corporate mission to put 
in practice the knowledge acquired during the previous stages. 
Alternatively, these four months could be spent carrying out research work 
on a topic related to the concepts developed during stages two and three.
Over and above the curriculum, a particular attention is paid to 
soft skills development centered on Leadership Development and 
Effective Communication Skills.
Last but not least, participants have to work on 2 projects, a multi-
cultural team project and an individual project, under the supervision 
of a faculty member and an executive from the corporate world.
