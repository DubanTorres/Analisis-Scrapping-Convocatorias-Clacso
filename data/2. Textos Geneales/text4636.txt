that is of interest and must reach with him an agreement on the possibility of joining his research 
team, as well as jointly define a Work Plan and related conditions. 
IV. 
Researchers from Brazil have to submit their proposal, in the dedicated portal, following agreements 
taken with the Principal Investigator holding the ERC grant and according to the orientations in Item 
no. 6.
