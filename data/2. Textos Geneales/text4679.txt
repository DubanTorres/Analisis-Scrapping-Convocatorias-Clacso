Call for Expression of Interest Call in the framework of the Implementing Arrangement between the 
European Commission and the Brazilian National Council of State Funding Agencies to provide research 
opportunities in Europe for Brazilian researchers 
1. OBJECTIVE: 
The Brazilian National Council for State Funding Agencies – CONFAP – invites Brazilian active Postdoctoral 
Grantees from the State Funding Agencies (FAPs), from the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher 
Education Personnel (CAPES) and from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development 
(CNPq), to pursue research collaborations with Principal Investigators already supported through EU-funded 
European Research Council (ERC) grants. 
 
2. MODALITIES: 
Principal Investigators holding ERC grants have expressed interest in hosting Brazilian researchers to 
contribute to their teams for short or longer periods (up to 12 months); 
Such expressions of interest have been sent to the European Research Council Executive Agency (ERCEA) who 
has shared them with CONFAP, according to the Implementing Agreement signed by the European 
Commission and CONFAP; 
On such basis, the present Call for Expression of Interest for Brazilian Researchers is launched.

w. The Human Mind and Its Complexity  
x. Cultures and Cultural Production  
y. The Study of the Human Past  
z. Synergy 
Modalities of implementation are divided in the following steps: 
I. 
Brazilian researchers should, in first instance, contact their respective FAP in order to verify if specific 
additional eligibility criteria are requested.  
II. 
Brazilian researchers interested in the up mentioned fields of research, and which comply with the 
eligibility conditions described in Item 4, are invited to send a Letter Expression of Interest to CONFAP 
(model provided in Annex A of the present call). 
III. 
Subsequently, CONFAP informs them, through the issuance of a Dear Colleague Letter, providing 
information about the ERC-funded projects that may host interested Brazilian researchers, including 
the description of their respective ERC-funded projects and contacts. 
IV. 
Brazilian researchers have to contact the Principal Investigator holding the ERC grant of the project 
that is of interest and must reach with him an agreement on the possibility of joining his research 
team as well as jointly define a Work Plan and related conditions. 
V. 
Brazilian researchers have to send to their respective FAPs their proposal, following agreements 
taken with the Principal Investigator holding the ERC grant and according to the orientations in Item 
4. 
VI. 
Each FAP involved (depending on the State of origin of the applicant Brazilian researcher) will assess 
the proposal and communicate to CONFAP the results of such assessment. 
VII. 
Results are then communicated to the ERC and to the Principal Investigator holding the ERC grant, 
and are subsequently published. 
 
3. FUNDING: 
Scientific exchanges shall start in the second semester of 2017 and can be either performed on a more 
extended timeframe (i.e. lasting 6 to 12 months) or be divided in multiple and shorter visits, i.e. to perform 
joint experimentation or similar research activities. 
Brazilian active Postdoctoral grantees from FAPs, CAPES and CNPq will continue to receive their salaries 
and/or scholarship according to their institutional terms and conditions. 
The Brazilian State Funding Agencies linked to the selected Brazilian Researchers (from the State of Origin of 
the researchers – i.e. where they actively work) will provide support for travel expenses. In case of a long-
term visit (6 months or longer); travel allowance for accompanying family may also be covered. 
Visiting Brazilian researchers which shall be incorporated into the research teams of the ERC-funded Principal 
Investigators (at the Host Institution of the ERC projects), for the duration of the visit, may receive support 
from the ERC grant, and such funding shall be negotiated and defined by the ERC funded Principal 
Investigators and the Brazilian researchers. 
The ERC-funded Principal Investigators are expected to establish and decide in advance, with the visiting 
Brazilian researcher, the research conditions, which should offer an enabling environment for the research 
visits and be in line with the applicable national law and any other rules and regulations applicable on the 
Host institution. 
The costs, which can be reimbursed under the ERC grant, must be eligible within the terms of the grant and 
the maximum amount of the ERC grant cannot be increased for this purpose. 
Eligible cost categories include:

a) subsistence costs on a per diem basis, or any other applicable modality of the Host Institution, in 
accordance with the applicable national law and any other rules or regulations applicable on the Host 
Institution, commensurate to the level of experience of the individual visiting researcher; 
b) any other eligible costs incurred during the visit of the Brazilian researchers that are directly related 
to the ERC-funded project. 
 
4. ELIGIBILITY: 
Eligible Brazilian Researchers are: active Postdoctoral Grantees from the State Funding Agencies (FAPs), from 
the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) and from the National Council 
for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). 
Under the present Call for Expressions of Interest, the interested researchers should, in first instance, contact 
their respective FAP in order to verify if specific additional eligibility criteria are requested. 
Submission of proposals:  
a) In a first step, researchers must send to CONFAP (Item 2, Point II): a letter of Expression of Interest, 
using the template indicated in Annex A of the present Call for Expression of Interest, in order to 
receive from CONFAP information about the ERC-funded projects that may host interested Brazilian 
researchers, including the description of their respective ERC-funded projects and contacts. 
 
The Letter for Expression of Interest must specify how the researcher complies to the eligibility 
criteria of the present call. 
 
b) In a second step, researchers must contact the ERC Grantee of the project that is of interest and 
reach an agreement on his participation. The researcher needs to receive from the ERC Grantee and 
from the Host Institution a formal acceptance, which is necessary in order to be eligible to submit 
the proposal to the respective FAP. 
 
c) In a third step, researchers must submit, directly to the respective FAP (Item 2, Point V):  
a. Curriculum Vitae; 
b. Work Plan, facilities and resources that the ERC-funded Principal Investigator and Host 
Institution shall provide to the Brazilian visiting researcher; 
c. Letter of Acceptance from the University or Research centre of Origin of the Brazilian 
researcher; 
d. Letter of Acceptance from the ERC-funded Principal Investigator, indicating his consent on 
integrating the Brazilian researcher in his team and on his proposal and Work Plan; 
e. Letter of Acceptance from the Host Institution in Europe, which confirms the availability to 
receive the Brazilian researcher in the terms and timing foreseen in the Work Plan. 
 
5. ASSESSMENT: 
Assessment of proposals will be done by each FAP individually and will be then communicated to CONFAP.  
Assessment criteria are based on the unique criteria of Scientific Excellence, in coherence and in order to be 
aligned with ERC grants.
