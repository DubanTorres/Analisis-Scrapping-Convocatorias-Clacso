1. Introduction 
The focus of the ERA-NET Cofund instrument under Horizon 2020 is the implementation of a single 
joint call for transnational collaborative research and innovation projects in selected areas, with high 
European added value and relevance for Horizon 2020. Therefore, the selected projects under the 
ERA-NET Cofund joint call receive top-up funding from the Commission. 
ERA-MIN 2 “Implement a European-wide coordination of research and innovation programs on raw 
materials to strengthen the industry competitiveness and the shift to a circular economy” is a 
progressive, pan-European network of research funding organisations that aims to develop the raw 
materials sector in Europe and globally. It builds on the experience of the FP7 ERA-NET ERA-MIN 
which was running from 2011 and 2015.  
ERA-MIN 2 aims to support the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, the EU Raw 
Materials Initiative and further develop the raw materials sector in Europe through funding of 
transnational research and innovation (R&I) activities. This will be achieved through one co-funded 
call in 2017, as well as two additional calls in 2018 and in 2019, designed and developed specifically 
for the non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials sector. The network will address four key 
objectives: 
• 
Support and promote R&I cooperation in Europe 
• 
Reduce fragmentation of R&I funding in the area of non-energy non-agricultural raw materials 
across Europe and globally 
• 
Provide a pan-European support network and financial resources to improve synergies, 
coordination and collaboration 
• 
Improve the eco-efficiency and impact of human and financial investment in R&I activities in the 
area of Raw Materials. 
The ERA-MIN 2 consortium consists of 21 funding organisations from 18 countries/regions (13 EU 
countries/regions, one Associated country, and four non-EU countries). Nine partners of ERA-MIN 2 
were also partners in ERA-MIN and eight other partners have participated in EU funded ERA-NETs 
since FP6, which gives the network an extensive experience with the coordination of national and 
regional funding programmes through the launch of joint transnational calls thus contributing to 
reduce fragmentation of R&I efforts across Europe.

In order to secure a sustainable and responsible supply of raw materials to the economy and 
industry, the ERA-MIN 2 joint call 2017 will address three segments of the non-energy, non-
agricultural raw materials: 
� Metallic, 
� Construction, and 
� Industrial minerals. 
The call topics of the ERA-MIN Joint Call 2017 will be based on challenges and priorities identified in 
the ERA MIN Research Agenda which is available on the ERA-MIN website, at: http://www.era-min-
eu.org/news/107-the-era-min-roadmap-published. It will be in line with the integrated strategy 
proposed in the EU Raw Materials Initiative, the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European 
Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, as well as with the national and regional priorities. ERA-
MIN 2 will liaise with the EIT on Raw Materials to offer complementary support and avoid duplication 
  
Page 5 of 14 
 
of efforts. ERA-MIN 2 is supporting the EU’s transition to a Circular Economy by addressing topics 
which are aiming at retaining the value of the raw materials we use in products and returning them 
into the product cycle at the end of their use, keeping in mind the need for a sustainable and 
responsible industrial supply of primary resources to feed the circular economy. 
 
2. Background 
Raw materials are particularly essential for the development of innovative environmentally friendly 
technologies and for the manufacture of the new and innovative products used in our modern 
society, such as batteries for electric cars, photovoltaic systems and components for wind turbines. 
Economic sectors such as construction, chemicals, automotive, aerospace, machinery and renewable 
energy correspond to more than 30 million jobs in the EU and depend on the sustainable supply of 
raw materials. 
New technologies in almost any area of the daily life will require increasing use of non-energy raw 
materials. Research to develop knowledge on exploration and mining remains vital. The eco-
efficiency of material production and use throughout the whole supply chain needs to be improved, 
turning this chain into a material’s circle where waste becomes the resource needed by another 
process, and dissipation is avoided as much as possible. Additionally, a significant reduction can be 
achieved by substituting scarce elements by more abundant ones with the same functionalities, or by 
substituting the functionality itself. 
A group of 150 experts have contributed to the ERA-MIN Research Agenda and have identified the 
main challenges of research and innovation on non-energy raw materials. The identified challenges 
cover major parts of the circular economy as shown in fig. 2 including cross-cutting issues: 
� Primary Resources: Improve techniques for exploration, mining and processing the primary 
resources that are necessary to satisfy the growing worldwide demand. As large, rich deposits 
located in countries that offer access to their mineral resources are getting rare, research is 
vital to explore for deeper-seated deposits (on-shore and off-shore), and to develop knowledge 
on unconventional resources.  
� Design: Reduce or avoid the use of scarce materials. A significant reduction can be achieved by 
substituting scarce elements by more abundant ones with the same functionalities, or by 
substituting the functionality itself. This requires specific research in the field of elements and 
material properties. Another possibility is to support innovative design to facilitate handling 
and dismantling. 
� Production, Remanufacturing / Use, Reuse and Repair / Recycling: Improve the eco-efficiency 
of material production and use throughout the whole supply chain to turn this chain into a 
materials circle where waste becomes the resource needed by another process, and where 
dissipation is avoided as much as possible. To achieve this, innovative recycling technologies for 
technology metals from complex products are as important as non-technical innovations, to 
obtain better access to secondary resources and ensure their resource efficient processing 
throughout the recycling chain, by reducing residual waste, water and energy use. 
� Production, Remanufacturing / Recycling: Overcome metallurgical and especially extractive 
metallurgy challenges to enable a resource (whether primary or secondary) to give raise to the 
  
Page 6 of 14 
 
metals used by the downstream industry. This will contribute to reducing Europe’s metal 
import dependency and create jobs and business opportunities. 
� Material cycle: Ensure, in harmony with the economic stakeholders and the society, the flow of 
minerals and metals needed by the economy, in line with the sustainable development 
framework. This requires reliable data and information on the global mineral resources 
industries, trade and non-trade barriers, market drivers, recycling and related facilities, trade 
flows, life-cycle and material flow data, etc., and the development of modelling integrating 
economic, environmental and social factors as well as objective functions controlling them. 
Such information and modelling is needed to develop and implement an EU non-energy 
mineral raw materials policy. 
 
Fig. 2: Raw materials within the circular economy 
With three joint calls and 17 transnational R&I projects supported with a budget of 13 million €, ERA-
MIN (2011-2015) has successfully contributed to develop the raw materials community in Europe 
and beyond, in line with the objectives of the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European 
Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials . During the lifetime of ERA-MIN the main focus of the 
funded R&I projects was shifted from the first part of the value chain, i.e. exploration and mining, to 
a more holistic approach covering also recycling and the substitution of critical raw materials1. ERA-
MIN 2 will build on these topics and cover the entire raw materials value chain, from sustainable 
exploration, exploitation, processing, substitution of critical raw materials and resource efficient 
production to short-term economic feasible and low environmental impact recycling. In line with

ongoing efforts to close the cycle within a circular economy approach, ERA-MIN 2 will put more 
emphasis on the contribution of proposals to the EU’s transition to a circular economy by funding 
projects aiming at retaining the value of the raw materials we use in products, by returning them, as 
much as possible, into the product cycle at the end of their use.  
3. The funding organisations 
The funding organisations are those organisations that are partners of ERA-MIN 2 and have agreed to 
allocate national/regional budgets for the joint call 2017 on the transition to a circular economy in 
Europe and in the world, and will implement jointly the joint call for proposals based on commonly 
agreed structures and procedures co-funded by the European Commission.

4. Scope of the ERA-MIN Joint Call 2017 and topics for funding 
The scope of the Joint Call is needs-driven research on non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials 
addressing one or several areas of the circular economy, as shown in Figure 2 above. As an 
overarching objective the proposed research should clearly demonstrate potential to foster the 
sustainable supply, processing, production and consumption of primary and secondary raw materials 
in a circular economy. All consortia should deliver convincing arguments on the potential impact of 
their innovation on the efficient supply, processing and use of raw materials. They should be able to 
quantify the expected impact using appropriate metrics and life cycle thinking. A specific work 
package on the follow up of these metrics in order to steer the project into the most environmentally 
beneficial direction could be an option. 
The ERA-MIN Joint Call 2017 will address three segments of raw materials: 
� Metallic, 
� Construction, and 
� Industrial minerals. 
 
The research, development and innovation topics to be funded under the ERA-MIN Joint Call 2017 
address all aspects of the non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials life cycle, covering both primary 
and secondary resources. Besides technological innovations, non-technological aspects will play an 
important role paving the way to a circular economy. Consortia may include players from the public 
and private sector with different backgrounds, e.g. physical scientists, engineers and technology 
developers, but also social scientists and policy advisors working closely together and covering 
different parts of the raw materials cycle. 
The call focuses on four parts of the raw materials life cycle and horizontal cross-cutting topics. 
Nevertheless, following a systemic approach, other parts of the production cycle which were not 
mentioned explicitly (e.g. distribution, use, collection) can be included within project proposals. IT-
based tools play an important role across the whole product life cycle to increase the efficiency of 
raw materials supply (e.g. inventories, supply chain management, automation). Special attention has 
to be paid to reconnecting raw materials to society. Therefore, applicants should indicate how their 
results will be disseminated to the public.  
 
For the objectives and expected impacts of the 5 topics supported by ERA-MIN Joint Call 2017 please 
see the description below. 
1. 
Supply of raw materials from exploration and mining: The availability of primary resources 
and waste from exploration and mining activities remains a major prerequisite to satisfy the 
growing global demand for raw materials. Therefore, exploration and mining will not disappear in 
a circular economy. Within this topic we are seeking for new techniques for the exploration and 
mining of primary and secondary resources that are necessary for the industrial supply. Proposals 
can address new concepts, technologies and improved models to be used in mineral exploration; 
comprehensive characterisation and mapping of abandoned mine sites, making them also 
potential sources of various raw materials (including various by- or co-products in complex 
  
Page 9 of 14 
 
mineral matrixes) in an environmentally friendly and socially accepted way. Proposals should aim 
at significant or demonstrable progress towards the goal of responsible and sustainable 
development, through increasing the raw materials supply while reducing impacts on the 
environment. Within this approach contributions on the reclamation of former mine sites are 
included. Both onshore and offshore proposals will be supported (subject to national/regional 
regulations). 
2. 
Design: The design of products has a high impact on resource efficiency. Within this topic we 
are seeking for proposals that contribute to the efficient use of raw materials for recycling, or the 
substitution of critical materials2 in products and components. In terms of a holistic view, aspects 
like the extension of the product durability or the facilitation of its recycling should be taken into 
account as well. Attention should be paid to strategies and technologies for the substitution of 
'substances of very high concern' (SVHCs) of the REACH regulation or which a scarcity may be 
foreseen. Applicants should be able to quantify the expected impact of the new product design on 
resource efficiency, using appropriate metrics and life cycle thinking.  
3. 
Processing, Production and Remanufacturing: Production efficiency and Remanufacturing 
processes in a circular economy provide a high potential to increase resource efficiency for 
primary and secondary sources. A major potential to increase the efficient use of raw materials is 
provided by resource intensive processes. Within a circular economy vision, waste occurring 
during the production phase could be recycled and therefore become a resource. In this topic we 
are looking for innovative technologies re-designing industrial processes. Therefore, a full 
understanding of the innovation and research needs across the life cycle is required to ensure 
that the greatest environmental benefits can be obtained. Proposals should address reduction of 
waste and/or recycling of waste, and additionally energy efficiency, environmental, and social 
impact could be considered. Proposals should be of high impact both in terms of the market 
opportunity they address, and the environmental/societal benefits they will enable.  
4. 
Recycling of End-of-Life Products: (e.g. waste of electric and electronic equipment (WEEE), 
batteries, end-of-life vehicles) is essential to turn the raw materials value chain into a materials 
cycle, where dissipation and waste is avoided as much as possible. A specific challenge is the 
recycling of raw materials from complex products. In this topic we are seeking for proposals to 
address this challenge through new concepts, technologies and services which increase the supply 
of raw materials from products and components at the end of their life. It is expected that the 
assessment of the potential impact of the proposed innovation on raw materials efficiency 
considers the whole life cycle of the products. Proposals could furthermore address additionally 
energy efficiency, environmental, and social impact could be considered. 
 
5. 
Cross-cutting topics that are relevant to any part of the raw materials life cycle can also be 
specifically addressed. Therefore, within this topic we are looking for proposals which propose 
non-technological innovations in order to increase the economic, environmental and social 
sustainability in the raw materials sector regarding: 
                                                           
2 The research is not restricted to the identified 20 critical raw materials (COM(2014) 297 final). 
  
Page 10 of 14 
 
� 
New business models, 
� 
Improvement of methods or data for environmental impact assessment,  
� 
Social acceptance and trust/public perception of raw materials. 
A major challenge in the raw materials sector is that entrepreneurs, with novel, high-impact and 
potentially transformative approaches to raw materials supply, may face barriers, such as 
substantive investments in existing infrastructure, making the system resistant to change. 
Applicants are therefore encouraged to respond to this challenge and to develop new business 
models for a successful implementation of the developed technologies. Development of new, 
efficient methods for environmental monitoring (including real time monitoring) are encouraged. 
Gaining public trust in industrial activities is increasingly important in securing the raw materials 
supply in Europe from primary and secondary sources. Understanding the public perception of 
raw materials related activities will be supported in the cross-cutting topics. To address the topic 
of social acceptance/public perception, adequate expertise both from social scientists and 
geoscientist/engineers/industry is essential. Proposals will be evaluated by considering the 
potential presented for new, high-impact and potentially transformative business models, 
environmental and/or societal benefits in the raw materials sector. 
More detailed information on sub-topic areas is shown in Appendix I. Not all funding organisations 
participate in each theme area and funding eligibility criteria may differ for some countries/regions. 
Applicants should check that the funding organisation for their country/region has confirmed its 
participation in the appropriate topic and sub-topic for their proposal; also which type of 
organisation may be funded at what level of support and the maximum budget available. A summary 
of these points is provided in Table 2 and in the national/regional funding regulations document but 
applicants are obliged to check with their national/regional contact point for this call. Background 
information on the research needs per topic and sub-topic areas was identified by the ERA-MIN 
research agenda, which can be downloaded from the ERA-MIN website at the following link: 
http://www.era-min-eu.org/news/107-the-era-min-roadmap-published. 
Both basic and applied research projects will be funded by the call funding agencies (based on the 
national rules applicable), provided that the proposed research clearly demonstrates potential to 
foster sustainable industrial supply of non-energy mineral resources for the circular economy. 
Target groups: All actors in the raw materials innovation chain, including academia, industry, NGOs, 
public authorities and civil society. Consortia involving both academic and industrial organisations are 
particularly encouraged to apply. Other types of consortia (e.g. purely industrial or academic) can 
also apply.

OBJETIVO 
O ERA-MIN 2 é um consórcio de 21 Organizações Financiadoras de pesquisa, desenvolvimento 
e inovação na área de matérias-primas minerais e suas fontes secundárias com enfoque na 
economia circular.  
O objetivo do consórcio ERA-MIN 2 é apoiar financeiramente, por meio de recursos não-
reembolsáveis (grants) projetos transnacionais de pesquisa e desenvolvimento e inovação, 
que sejam desenvolvidos de forma conjunta por empresas e ICTs, nos seguintes segmentos de 
matérias-primas não energéticas e não agrícolas: 
- Metálicos; 
- Construção; 
- Minerais industriais. 
O foco destes temas está voltado para o suprimento, produção, consumo, reutilização e 
reciclagem de matérias-primas de forma sustentável em uma economia circular. 
A economia circular é uma economia industrial orientada para uma maior produtividade dos 
recursos reduzindo desperdícios e impactos ambientais ao longo de todo ciclo de vida de um 
produto, incluindo sua reintrodução na cadeia produtiva. Isto pode ser alcançado pela busca 
de mais eficiência em vias, seja a do suprimento, processamento, design, reciclagem ou 
reúso, dentre outras. 
Com isto em vista, estabelece-se esta Chamada de co-financiamento, na qual cada agência 
apoia a empresa / instituição de seu respectivo país, de acordo com seus próprios 
instrumentos de apoio.

PROCEDIMENTOS DE AVALIAÇÃO E SELEÇÃO 
As propostas serão avaliadas quanto a sua elegibilidade, considerando tanto as regras da 
Chamada quanto as regras específicas das Organizações Financiadoras. 
A avaliação da qualidade das propostas será realizada com auxílio de um Comitê Científico de 
Avaliação (Scientific Evaluation Board – SEB) composto por experts independentes. Ressalta-se 
que o processo de avaliação será monitorado por um observador independente, o qual 
preparará um relatório de avaliação para a Comissão Europeia. 
Os critérios de avaliação quanto à qualidade das propostas são: i) Excelência científica; ii) 
Impacto; e iii) Qualidade e Eficiência na implementação. 
Esta lógica se aplica tanto para a etapa de pré-propostas como propostas completas. 
A etapa de avaliação das pré-propostas visa identificar aquelas com melhor qualidade para a 
etapa seguinte (avaliação das propostas completas). Nesta primeira etapa o Comitê Dirigente 
da Chamada (Call Steering Committee - CSC) irá selecionar as propostas para a fase seguinte 
por meio de consenso, com base no ranking gerado pelo Scientific Evaluation Board, conforme 
os critérios de avaliação e sua elegibilidade.

propostas. Neste processo, ou deverão responder a questionamentos e/ou apontamentos 
apresentados pelos avaliadores, os quais serão considerados na avaliação das propostas 
completas. 
A etapa de avaliação das propostas completas elegíveis também se dá pelo consenso do 
Comitê Dirigente da Chamada com base no ranking gerado pelo Scientific Evaluation Board. 
Para a seleção das propostas será considerada a disponibilidade dos fundos nacionais / 
regionais das Organizações bem como o co-financiamento da Comissão Europeia. O Brasil não

5. The funding model 
The Call is based on the existing RTD funding schemes or programmes in the field of non-energy, non-
agricultural raw materials in the participating countries and regions. This means that each beneficiary in a 
proposal selected for funding under the Call on “Raw materials for sustainable development and the circular 
economy” will be funded by the Funding Organisation of their own country/region.  
The total budget available for this Call is approximately € 15 million corresponding to the sum of national 
and regional public committed funds of the participating Funding Organisations and the co-funding of the 
European Commission (Table 2).   
In addition to the rules for participation and funding set by the Call, each applicant requesting funding in a 
submitted proposal must also comply with the national /regional rules and regulations of the funding 
programme of their respective country or region (see National/Regional Funding Regulations document). 
The final funding decisions are made by the participating Funding Organisations.

7. Recommendations for applicants 
• 
The following documents should be carefully read: 
o «Call Text» - It includes the scope, objectives and expected impacts of the research topics 
and sub-topics of the Call and the topics covered by each Funding Organisation; 
  
Page 10 of 35 
 
o «National/regional Funding Regulations» - It includes the national/regional funding 
regulations of the participating Funding Organisations, namely the eligible organisations for 
funding, eligible costs, eligible type of research and the funding rates;  
o «Guidelines for Applicants» - It includes the procedures to follow in order to submit the pre-
proposals and the full-proposals, the proposals templates, the eligibility criteria, the 
scientific evaluation procedures, the evaluation criteria and monitoring and reporting 
procedures for the funded projects;  
• 
One (and only one) coordinator, represented by a lead researcher, has to be nominated among the 
partners to represent the consortium; 
• 
The coordinator should register in advance in the ERA-MIN Electronic Proposal Submission System 
(http://www.submission-era-min.eu/); 
• 
The applicants are encouraged to prepare the pre-proposal and the full-proposal in advance; 
• 
The applicants are encouraged to register all required data in the Electronic Proposal Submission 
System, taking into account that the system may be overloaded on the deadline date; 
• 
The applicants have to make sure that their proposal falls into the scope and the topics of the Call 
(read the topics and sub-topics of the call on the «Call Text»). A proposal may cover more than one 
of the topics and sub-topics; 
• 
The ERA MIN 2 consortium is aiming to reduce the disparities and level up innovation performance 
of raw materials between the countries participating in this Call, and thus it encourages cooperation 
beyond the EU Member States or Associated Countries. In this line, the involvement of applicants 
from the third countries participating in the Call, namely, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and South Africa) is 
highly desirable;  
• More than two partners from more than two countries forming a consortium are encouraged to 
apply;  
• The consortium size should be suitable for the level and complexity of the project and each partner 
should have a significant contribution for the transnational added value of collaboration; 
• 
Large, medium and small-size companies are particularly encouraged to apply; 
• 
The proposal should clearly identify the specific contribution of each partner in the consortium and 
the added value of working together; 
• 
The applicants have to make sure that their proposal fulfils the Call eligibility criteria, as well as the 
national/regional eligibility criteria;  
• 
Well in advance of submitting an application, every partner must contact the local contact point of 
their country/region and confirm with their respective Funding Organisation that the 
national/regional funding criteria and regulations are met. If required, national/regional submission 
forms or documents should be submitted to the respective Funding Organisation within the 
specified deadline, no later than one week after the proposal submission deadline; 
• 
The pre-proposal has to be submitted via the ERA-MIN Electronic Proposal Submission System 
(http://www.submission-era-min.eu/) not later than 5 May 2017, at 17:00:00 CEST by the 
coordinator. 
  
Page 11 of 35 
 
• 
As to the «Technical description of the proposal», the same font and style should be used (Times 
New Roman or Calibri, 11pt, single spaced; the template’s margins of the page should be kept) and 
a maximum of 6 pages and 22 pages for pre-proposal and full-proposal, respectively, should be 
respected, excluding the financial plan, references  and annexes. 
• The expected size of a proposal in terms of total funding is typically in the range of 0.3 to 1.5 million 
Euro. 
• In order to find potential partners to build a consortium, a web-based partner search tool has been 
set up by the NCPs-CaRE. This tool is available on the NCPs-CaRE website (http://partnersearch.ncps-
care.eu/). 
 
8. Call procedures: submission; evaluation, selection, funding and reporting  
The CSC and the JCS will take all lawful steps to ensure confidentiality of information and documents 
obtained during the submission, evaluation and selection procedures of the Call. 
8.1. Proposal submission 
There will be a two-stage submission procedure: pre-proposals and full proposals. 
A joint transnational proposal (pre-proposal) shall be prepared in English by the consortium and submitted 
via the ERA-MIN Electronic Proposal Submission System by the lead researcher representing the coordinator. 
The pre-proposal submission is mandatory and must be submitted no later than 5 May, 2017 (Friday) at 
17:00:00 CEST. 
If required by the national/regional regulations, the submission forms, or documents, must be submitted 
directly to the participating Funding Organisations according with their deadlines, no later than one week 
after the proposal submission deadline. Please consult the respective local contact point of the Funding 
Organisations (section 4) for further details. 
Full proposals must be submitted by the coordinator in electronic format no later than 28 September 2017 
(Thursday), at 17:00:00 CEST. Full proposals will be accepted only from those applicants explicitly invited by 
the JCS to submit them. 
A revision of the overall application is allowed under certain conditions after the pre-proposal stage. In any 
case, all changes from pre- to full-proposal have to be coordinated with all involved Funding Organisations 
by the coordinator. As some Funding Organisations do not allow changes, partners should be advised to 
check the national/regional funding regulations document to see if their respective Funding Organisation 
allows changes between the pre- and full-proposal stage.

8.1.1. Registration 
The coordinator2 (Partner 1), who will represent the consortium, will have to register at the ERA-MIN 
Electronic Proposal Submission System (http://www.submission-era-min.eu/) before submitting a pre-
proposal. Once registered, the coordinator will receive a registration email. 
The coordinator will need to register the partners of the consortium. After registration, all the partners will 
receive an email to activate their account. With his/her account, each partner will enter his/her own profile. 
8.1.2. Proposal form 
The pre-proposal form (Appendix III and IV) and full proposal form (Appendix V) must be filled by the 
coordinator, with the exception of the partner’s profiles.  
The proposals must be written in English and submitted via the ERA-MIN Electronic Proposal Submission 
System (http://www.submission-era-min.eu/. 
Signed Statement of Commitments from all consortium coordinator/partner requesting funding (Form B- 
Appendix VI) and Declarations of own funding (Form C- Appendix VII) from partners not requesting funding 
have to be included as annexes to the pre-proposal. The coordinator has the duty to ensure that Form B and 
Form C are signed in due time. Resubmitting the pre-proposal/full-proposal before the submission deadline 
is possible. 
8.2 Evaluation procedures 
The evaluation procedures are designed to identify the best proposals in terms of scientific excellence, 
impact, quality and efficiency on the implementation, as thoroughly and accurately as possible; and to 
undertake the assessment in a fair, transparent and homogeneous way for all proposals submitted to the 
Call. 
The quality assessment of the submitted proposals will be performed by the SEB composed of international 
independent expert reviewers.  
Stage 1 assessment of pre-proposals will be carried out at a Call level by the JCS, at a national /regional level 
by the CSC and at an international scientific peer-review by the SEB. Stage 2 assessments of full proposals 
will be conducted by a panel of, at least, three independent experts that sign Declarations of Confidentiality 
and Conflict of Interest. The evaluation process will be monitored by an independent observer who will 
prepare a report on the assessment process for the European Commission. 
                                                           
2 The coordinator (partner 1) will be responsible for running and managing the project. The lead researcher 
representing the coordinator will be the contact point with ERA-MIN 2 Joint Call Secretariat on behalf of the whole 
consortium and will be responsible for the administrative management of the complete project, should it be awarded 
funding. In addition, the lead researcher is responsible for leading the project activities at his/her own organisation. The 
coordinator must be eligible for funding. 
  
Page 13 of 35 
 
8.2.1. Evaluation stage 1: Pre-Proposals  
The submitted pre-proposals will be subject to an eligibility check performed by the JCS and by the CSC to 
confirm compliance with national/regional priorities, rules and regulations. In parallel, scientific assessments 
of pre-proposals will be remotely performed by the SEB. 
All eligible pre-proposals that meet the Call eligibility criteria will be allocated to three designated experts of 
the SEB according to their expertise relevant for the topic of the pre-proposal. Pre-proposals will be assessed 
based on the three main evaluation criteria: 1) Scientific Excellence; 2) Impact and 3) Quality and Efficiency 
of the Implementation. A ranked list of pre-proposals will be produced based on the final scores.  
The selection of pre-proposals for the stage 2 will be decided at a CSC consensus meeting to finalise the 
stage 1 pre-proposal assessment. A list of projects of high quality will be invited to submit a full proposal for 
Stage 2.  
8.2.2. Evaluation stage 2: Full-Proposals  
The submitted full-proposals will be subject to an eligibility check performed by the JCS and by the CSC to 
confirm compliance with national/regional priorities, rules and regulations before the start of the 
international independent peer-review evaluation process.   
Full Proposals will be evaluated based on three main evaluation criteria: 1) Scientific Excellence, 2) Impact 
and 3) Quality and Efficiency of the Implementation.  
8.2.3 Evaluation Criteria, scoring system and thresholds 
The evaluation of proposals is based on the following three main evaluation criteria and sub-criteria: 
Criterion 1. SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE 
1.1. Clarity and pertinence of the objectives; 
1.2. Soundness of the concept, and credibility of the proposed methodology; 
1.3. Extent that the proposed work is beyond the state of the art, and demonstrates innovation 
potential (e.g. ground-breaking objectives, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services 
or business and organisational models); 
1.4. Appropriate consideration of interdisciplinary approaches and, where relevant, use of 
stakeholder knowledge (only for stage 2); 
 
Criterion 2. IMPACT 
2.1. The extent to which the outputs of the project would contribute at the European and/or 
International level to the expected impacts mentioned in the work programme under the relevant 
topic; 
2.2. Any substantial impacts not mentioned in the work programme, that would enhance innovation 
capacity, create new market opportunities, strengthen competitiveness and growth of companies, 
address issues related to barriers/obstacles, and any framework conditions such as regulation, 
standards, public acceptance, workforce considerations, financing of follow-up steps, cooperation of 
other links in the value chain, or bring other important benefits for society (only for stage 2); 
  
Page 14 of 35 
 
2.3 Quality of the proposed measures to exploit and disseminate the project results (including 
management of IPR), and to manage research data where relevant (only for stage 2); 
 2.4. Quality of the proposed measures to communicate the project activities to different target 
audiences (only for stage 2);  
2.5 Support the development of technological solutions and services for the implementation of the 
Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials. 
 
Criterion 3. QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION 
3.1. Quality and effectiveness of the work plan, including extent to which the resources assigned to 
work packages are in line with their objectives and deliverables (only for stage 2);  
3.2. Appropriateness of the management structures and procedures, including risk and innovation 
management (only for stage 2);  
3.3. Quality and complementarity of the participants and extent to which the consortium as whole 
brings together the necessary expertise; 
3.4. Appropriateness of the allocation of tasks, ensuring that all participants have a valid role and 
adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role (only for stage 2). 
 
Evaluation scores will be awarded to the three main evaluation criteria and not for the different sub-criteria. 
Each main evaluation criterion is rated using the 0-5 scale (half-points are not allowed): 
0  — The proposal fails to address the criterion or cannot be assessed due to missing or incomplete 
information (unless the result of an ‘obvious clerical error’) 
1— Poor: the criterion is inadequately addressed or there are serious inherent weaknesses 
2—Fair: the proposal broadly addresses the criterion but there are significant weaknesses 
3—Good: the proposal addresses the criterion well but with a number of shortcomings 
4—Very good: the proposal addresses the criterion very well but with a small number of 
shortcomings 
5—Excellent: the proposal successfully addresses all relevant aspects of the criterion; any 
shortcomings are minor. 
 
Each criterion will be scored out of 5 and the threshold for individual criterion will be 3.  
For the evaluation of pre-proposals the three main evaluation criteria will apply but with fewer sub-criteria 
(those indicated as “only for stage 2” will NOT be considered).   
For each pre-proposal assessment, the overall rating (0-15) will be the sum of the individual criterion scores. 
The overall threshold for pre-proposals will be 9.  
The coordinators will receive the results of the pre-proposal assessment including the peer-review reports 
and will be able to address the evaluators’ questions in the full-proposals.  
For each full-proposal, the overall rating (0-15) will be the sum of the individual criterion scores. The overall 
threshold for full-proposals, applying to the sum of the three individual scores, will be 10.  
  
Page 15 of 35 
 
At the SEB meeting, a ranking list will be established for eligible full proposals with overall rating at, or 
above, 9 and with all the main evaluation criterion scores at, or above, 3. Proposals not meeting the 
thresholds will not be recommended for funding by the SEB.  
8.3. Selection procedures and feedback to applicants 
The CSC will strive to ensure that the top-ranked full-proposals are funded to the maximum extent possible. 
The selection of full-proposals will be based on the ranking list of eligible full-proposals provided by the SEB 
meeting and the available national/regional budgets until exhaustion of public funds (EU contribution 
included). A CSC consensus meeting will be organised to finalise Stage 2 and to elaborate the “joint selection 
list” of projects recommended for funding.  
All coordinators will receive feedback on the results of the evaluation process after both Stage 1 and Stage 2, 
including the Evaluation Summary Reports. The coordinators will be instructed to communicate the 
decisions to the consortium partners. 
8.4. Funding decisions and consortium agreement 
8.4.1. Funding decisions and start of projects 
For proposals recommended for funding, the partners will be asked to contact the respective Funding 
Organisation for further instructions regarding national/regional internal procedures. The negotiation phase 
is carried out following the usual rules of each Funding Organisation, amended by special procedures for the 
Call. 
Funding Organisation’s representatives shall outline the timing of their internal procedures to ensure that all 
beneficiaries of one project can begin with the research project at the same point in time. 
The beneficiaries of successful collaborative projects will be funded directly by the respective national or 
regional Funding Organisation. The funding rate within the Call will be variable according to 
national/regional rules. Eligible costs may vary according to the corresponding national/regional regulations 
of the respective funding organisation.  
Thus, each beneficiary will have a separate funding contract/letter of grant according to national/regional 
regulations with the appropriate national/regional Funding Organisation. The JCS will ensure that the 
partners of each project selected for funding enter into an appropriate grant with their relevant 
national/regional Funding Organisation.  
Changes to the composition of research consortia or to the budget cannot occur during the contract/letter 
of grant, unless there is an appropriate justification. The beneficiaries shall inform the JCS and the Funding 
Organisations of that project of any event that might affect the implementation of the project. 
The partners of the projects selected for funding must fix a common project start date, which will be the 
reference date for annual and final reports. It is expected that grant negotiations may take up to 3-4 months 
after the notification of results. The latest starting date is 1st May 2018. All funded projects must be 
  
Page 16 of 35 
 
completed and reported back within the lifetime of the ERA-MIN 2, at least 6 months before the end of ERA-
MIN 2 (November 2021). 
The list of funded projects will be published on the ERA-MIN 2 website and on the websites of the 
participating Funding Organisations. 
8.4.2. Consortium Agreement 
The beneficiaries of a project selected for funding must sign a Consortium Agreement (CA) for cooperation, 
preferably before the official project start date but no later than six months after the official project start 
date, considering that some Funding Organisations cannot conclude the grant agreements without a signed 
CA. Each Funding Organisation will indicate when they expect the CA and how to submit it.  A copy of the 
duly signed CA should be sent to the Funding Organisations.   
The purpose of the CA is to ensure a well-functioning research collaboration and protection of partners’ 
rights and obligations. Moreover, the CA should provide for a decision making process to deal with all 
relevant issues during the project lifetime. Models of CA are available (http://www.desca-2020.eu/). 
Nevertheless, the consortium is free to define its own CA subject to applicable legal and regulatory 
provisions. For guidance, the following items are usually addressed in a CA: 
− 
Purpose of and definitions used in the CA; 
− 
Common start date of the research project; 
− 
Project structure and project management; 
− 
Detailed identification of partners’ contributions (financial contributions, Intellectual 
Property Rights’ constitutions, personnel, etc.); 
− 
Role and responsibilities of the project coordinator and the partners among themselves 
(e.g.; a proper communication and transmission of information within the project 
consortium) and towards the Funding Organisations and the European Commission, if 
applicable; 
− 
Decision making process within the consortium properly reflecting the weight of each 
partner in the consortium (i.e., at proportion of partners’ respective contributions; 
− 
Resources and funding (e.g., each partner is responsible of the use of its own funding and 
must inform officially the whole consortium of resources difficulties in driving the work); 
− 
Confidentiality and the rules for publishing (e.g., priority to patents as a first option and then 
requirement of a consortium decision before publication; mandatory information of all the 
partners before any kind of external communication. Decision to take by the consortium 
regarding the list of names as authors of the publication (all the names or solely the direct 
contributors); 
− 
Management of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR): identification of pre-existing 
IPR/Background; allocation of IPR and access to IPR among partners at proportion of their 
respective contributions;  
− 
Handling of internal disputes; 
− 
The liabilities of the project partners. 
 
 
  
Page 17 of 35 
 
The national/regional Funding Organisations shall have the right to use documents, information and results 
submitted by the research partners and/or to use the information and results according to their 
national/regional rules on IPR. 
 
8.5. Monitoring and reporting procedures 
Monitoring procedures will verify that all allocated resources are timely deployed to the research teams and 
by providing up-to-date progress information that can be used for administrative actions and strategic 
planning. ERA-MIN 2 will implement a low-effort online monitoring system as a common data base of funded 
projects for: (i) interim progress updates (monitoring of performance): a real-time resource-efficient 
monitoring of annual progress and proper performance of running projects; (ii) monitoring of successful 
completion by questionnaire. 
On behalf of the consortium, the coordinators of the funded projects will submit annual and final reports to 
the JCS, in English, that contains information on scientific and administrative aspects. In addition, each 
beneficiary in a selected funded project must report to their respective national/regional funding 
organisation, according to their administrative funding rules. The beneficiaries are instructed to immediately 
contact the coordinator, the Funding Organisations involved and the JCS with any contingency that may 
arise. 
This data base respects appropriate and secure use of material and data according to the application of 
common standards, following the guidelines on data management in Horizon 2020. The collected data will 
require a prior informed consent, will be protected and secured, in order to avoid a malevolent use of it.  
The mid-term scientific evaluation exercise of funded projects will be based on the annual project reports 
and presentations made by the coordinators at the mid-term Seminar with the participation of the CSC 
members and invited stakeholders.  As a result, the CSC may propose the continuation, the re-organisation 
or the suspension of the research project activities. Accordingly, travel expenses to attend this Seminar and 
the final Seminar should be included in the proposal budget plans, if eligible for the Funding Organisations. 
The final scientific evaluation of funded projects will be organised under the ERA-MIN 2 Final Conference 
based on the final project reports and presentations made by the coordinators. 
The final assessment results will be made available on the ERA-MIN 2 website and a wider dissemination 
through other relevant means will be carried out. 
The representative of the coordinator should attend a minimum of two meetings organised by ERA-MIN 2 
(mid-term and final seminars). In addition, the beneficiaries are expected to participate and contribute to 
any communication activity initiated by ERA-MIN 2 in the funding period and beyond. 
Beneficiaries must ensure that all project publications, etc. include a proper acknowledgement to ERA-MIN 
2, the European Commission, and the respective Funding Organisation.

9. Open Access and Open Data 
The optimisation of the impact of publicly-funded scientific research is of fundamental importance to 
improve conditions to i) minimise the time spent searching for information and accessing it, ii) be able to 
speed up scientific progress, and iii) make it easier to cooperate across and beyond the European Union. 
Open Access recommendations for all scientific publications produced by the funded projects will support 
Green Open Access (immediate or delayed open access provided through self-archiving), and/or Gold Open 
Access (immediate open access provided by a publisher) only depending on cost eligibility. In the case of 
Green Open Access, partners will (as soon as possible and at the latest on publication) deposit a machine-
readable electronic copy of the published version or final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication 
in a repository for scientific publications. In addition, partners will ensure open access to the deposited 
publication and bibliographic metadata. 
In relation to Open Data, the funded projects will be recommended to submit metadata on all the data 
resources directly generated by the project on the Raw Material Information System (RMIS) of JRC, as well as 
additional information on how these data will be exploited, if and how data will be made accessible for 
verification and re-use, and how it will be curated and preserved. Metadata and additional information will 
be made publicly available via the ERA-MIN website. The Contact Point on Open Access and Open Data will 
be disseminated on ERA-MIN website, alongside specific information and procedures to follow.

1. Contexte et objectifs de la collaboration  
En lien avec les différents défis sociétaux, l’ANR a développé des partenariats multilatéraux avec ses 
homologues européens dans le cadre des actions européennes de type ERA-NET, ERA-NET COFUND 
ou initiatives de programmation conjointe (JPI). Ces actions sont complémentaires aux projets 
collaboratifs classiques des programmes cadres. Dans cette perspective, l'accent est mis sur un 
raisonnement pluriannuel de priorisation des activités européennes et d'articulation des outils 
nationaux et européens. 
  
Page 37 of 41 
 
Afin de simplifier et de fluidifier les modalités de collaboration, et de contribuer à la construction de 
l’Espace européen de la recherche (EER), l’ANR a décidé de s’engager au sein de l’ERA-NET COFUND 
ERA-MIN II. 
L’objectif est de contribuer au financement des projets européens et internationaux, démontrant un 
haut niveau d’excellence scientifique, en soutenant la participation des équipes nationales. 
Le présent appel à projets concerne le support au développement industriel européen par des 
actions de recherche dans le domaine des matières premières non agricoles et non énergétiques. 
L’objectif est bien de participer pour l’Europe à une sécurisation des ressources en matière premières 
de ce type, qu’elles soient primaires ou secondaires avec l’obligation d’en assurer une gestion 
responsable et durable. Les matières premières visées sont les minerais métalliques, les matériaux de 
construction et les matériaux industriels. Les ressources considérées peuvent être indifféremment 
primaires ou secondaires comme les mines urbaines et les déchets des appareils électriques et 
électroniques. Pour y parvenir, le financement fourni par les programmes nationaux et régionaux des 
États membres et d’autres pays sera combiné avec les efforts de la Commission européenne dans 
l’appel cofinancé pour les projets de recherche multilatéraux portant sur « L’implémentation d’une 
collaboration européenne de recherche et d’innovation dans le domaine des matières premières afin 
d’augmenter la compétitivité industrielle et avancer vers l’économie circulaire ». 
Le but de ERA-MIN 2 est de créer des liens entre partenaires de recherche ayant une expertise 
scientifique et technologique différente mais complémentaire afin de maximiser les ressources et de 
partager les risques, les coûts et les compétences. Une condition préalable pour que les projets 
transnationaux soient pris en charge par l’intermédiaire de cet appel est l’inclusion des différentes 
parties de la chaîne de valeur, pour faciliter la mise sur le marché des technologies ou services 
nouvellement développés. Le partenariat entre les chercheurs industriels et universitaires dans les 
domaines des matières premières et de l’économie circulaire permettra d’améliorer et d’accélérer le 
transfert de technologie, et de renforcer les efforts européens pour parvenir à une sécurisation des 
ressources ainsi qu’à leur gestion efficace et responsable permettant de soutenir durablement le 
développement industriel. 
 
2. Périmètre de l’appel conjoint 
2.1 Objectif de l’appel conjoint 
L’objectif de l’appel est de contribuer à la sécurisation de l’industrie européenne en matières 
premières non énergétiques et non agricoles, dans une approche responsable et durable convoquant 
les principes de l’économie circulaire. 5 thèmes principaux ont été identifiés : 
Thème 1 - Approvisionnement en matières premières, composé de 3 sous-thèmes, 1.1 exploration, 
1.2 Opérations minières, 1.3 fermeture des mines et suivi ;
