Toon Monbaliu 
eranet@fwo.be 
+32 2 550 15 70 
Eligible Institutions 
See ‘Eligible applicants’ section. 
Eligible Applicants 
The FWO participates with its (junior/senior) ‘research projects’ funding channel, which 
implies that these specific regulations apply: 
See articles 10-12 (in essence this comes down to holding an eligible ‘ZAP-position’ at a 
Flemish, eligible main host institution.) 
Eligible Costs 
FWO (sub)projects are capped at max. 350.000 EUR per project/consortium (incl. 6% 
overhead). In total, the FWO foresees a budget of 700.000 EUR, which allows funding 2-
3 projects. For the overhead calculation the following method has to be respected: a 6% 
structural overhead should be calculated on the direct costs. E.g.: the sum of all costs 
(personnel, consumables, travel, etc.) amount to 300.000 EUR, then the overhead will 
amount to 18.000 EUR (6% of 300.000 EUR) and the total requested cost 318.000 EUR. 
This total requested cost may never exceed 350.000 EUR. 
Admitted costs 
Only temporary personnel can be remunerated. 
For the cost categories see chapters 7 and 8 of the regulations. 
Funding Commitment 
Total Amount for the Call 
Maximum Amount Per Proposal 
700.000 EUR 
350.000 EUR (incl. 6% structural 
overhead) 
Other Funding Criteria 
One and the same researcher can participate in 2 different research projects/consortia 
at maximum when applying for FWO funding, within the same call.  
Researchers are asked to inform their central coordination unit, at their host institution, 
about their participation. 
Projects may last up to 36 months, which implies the funding has to be budgeted and 
spent accordingly. Extensions are not allowed.

Relevant documents 
Make sure that all consortium partners go thoroughly through the call documents 
and national regulations. 
Additional Info 
It is advised to contact the FWO before submission (see contact point 
above), in order to avoid ineligible projects and consortia. 
ERA-NET participation does not interfere with the ‘regular’ project submission 
framework, and is consequently not taken into account for calculating the max. available 
number of new applications and running projects combined.
