There must be a clear distinction of new elements and value addition to projects that have been previously 
funded by the WRC through national calls for projects further submitted to the WaterJPI call. Failure to clearly 
distinguish the new elements will lead to the project being rejected for national funding following JPI approval.

National Regulations   
Additional Info 
(1) SA partners are encouraged to include students in the projects for capacity building. 
(2) Before submitting the project outline to the 2018 call secretariat, it is advised that the SA partner share the 
project outline with the WRC also highlighting the required financial cost to the SA partner to get WRC 
endorsement to the project. The project outlines should be submitted to the WRC not later than 2 weeks 
before the call deadline to allow sufficient time for the WRC expert to assess the application. Those submitted 
in less than 2 weeks before the call deadline may not receive WRC endorsement prior to submitting the 
proposal to the call secretariat. 
(3) The WRC National Contact Point will facilitate and assist with partner matching between SA and for WaterJPI 
call partners countries. 
(4) To raise awareness and promote the call in SA, the WRC will share the information on the call information 
session that will be conducted virtually by the WaterWorks2017 and also live stream the session using WRC 
social media channels. The WRC will further conduct national information sessions targeted at large audience 
and also be available for bilateral meetings with individual institution as per invitation.

Water JPI 2018 Transnational Joint Call 
“Closing the Water Cycle Gap – Sustainable Management of Water Resources” 
2018 Transnational Joint Call presentation 
In many regions, it may be difficult to reconcile water supply and demand both in terms of quantity and quality. 
Europe is not an arid continent, however water scarcity affects at least 11% of the European population and 
17% of the territory. Water resources observation, experimental work and modelling are required to better 
understand hydrological processes and their connection, and to analyse and forecast the effectiveness of 
management options.  
To address this challenge, the Water JPI action WaterWorks2017 will be implemented through the 2018 Joint 
Call, in order to finance research projects focusing on Theme 5 of the Water JPI Strategic Research & Innovation 
Agenda (SRIA 2.0): “Closing the Water Cycle Gap – Sustainable Management of Water Resources”. Through this 
initiative, the Water JPI aims at developing transnational collaborative research, development and innovation 
projects meeting water challenges faced by Europe and beyond, and supporting the implementation of EU 
water policies. This call will cover the following themes: 
1. Enabling sustainable management of water resources; and 
2. Strengthening socio-economic approaches to water management 
3. Supporting Tools for Sustainable Integrated Management of Water Resources 
 
The Water JPI 2018 Joint Call is funded by 20 Funding Partner Organisations (FPOs) from 18 countries, for a 
global estimated budget of 19.3 M€ including a Cofund from the European Commission of 5,9 M€. This call is 
for collaborative transnational research proposals. Each consortium must be composed of eligible independent 
entities from a minimum of 3 countries with FPOs involved in the Call, including eligible entities from at least 2 
EU Member States or H2020 framework programme Associated countries. Each research partner involved in a 
project must comply with the eligibility rules and criteria of its FPO. 
MORE INFORMATION 
For more information on the call (call announcement, funding countries, national/regional regulations, 
assessment criteria, submission forms, and submission platform), please consult the 2018 Joint Call webpage 
on the Water JPI website. 
For general information on the call, please contact the Call Secretariat - ww17@formas.se 
For specific questions related to the budget, criteria and rules of your funding partner organisation, please 
consult your National Contact Point. Each research team is encouraged to contact its NCP before submitting a 
proposal.  
If you are looking for a Research Partner for your Project or for a Project to join, please do not hesitate to join 
our LinkedIn Researchers Forum Group https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8455262. 
The webinar scheduled for 12 March 2018 will answer all your questions! More details and registration on the
