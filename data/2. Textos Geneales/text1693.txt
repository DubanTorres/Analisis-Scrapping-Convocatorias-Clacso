in accordance with, the laws of England and Wales. 
27.2 
Subject to the remainder of this clause 27, the parties irrevocably agree that the courts of

resolve the dispute or claim in accordance with this clause 27.3, either party may commence 
proceedings in accordance with clause 27.2. 
27.4

obligations of confidentiality contained in this Agreement or infringement, or threatened 
infringement, of the applicant's Intellectual Property Rights.
