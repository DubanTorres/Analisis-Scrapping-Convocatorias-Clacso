GUIDELINES FOR APPLICANTS  
APRIL 2017 VERSION 0.8 
Countries included in this call are: 
 Brazil | India | Kenya |  Malaysia | South Africa  | Thailand  |  Vietnam 
Call opens: 3 April 2017 
Call closes: 13 June 2017 
1. Background 
The Newton Fund aims to build UK-partner country collaborations centred on shared research 
and innovation challenges which have direct relevance to Newton Fund partner countries’ social 
welfare and economic development. It is managed by UK Government’s Department for 
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and delivered through 15 UK delivery partners in 
collaboration with 16 partner countries. 
Tackling global challenges – such as extreme weather conditions, urbanisation, access to 
affordable health care, food and energy security, and meeting the social and economic needs of 
a growing population – requires an integrated research and innovation approach, bringing 
together communities from different disciplines, sectors, and countries in high-quality 
collaborations. 
All Researcher Links-funded workshops will have the following three overarching objectives: 
 
Support international development-relevant research – Workshops are intended to 
support research areas relevant to the economic development and welfare of partner 
countries. 
 
Contribute to capacity building of early career researchers – The proposal must include 
a description of how the workshop will contribute to the personal and professional 
development of the participants. Workshop co-ordinators should indicate how they envisage 
this occurring, including any plans for long-term mentoring of early career researchers (either 
within each country, or cross-nationally). 
 
Establish new research links or significantly develop existing links, with the potential 
for longer term sustainability – Co-ordinators must outline the specific outputs anticipated 
from the workshop. The aim of the workshop is to stimulate longer term links between the UK 
and partner countries, as well as to contribute to the personal and professional development 
of the participants. The workshop proposal should include an explanation of the mutual 
benefits to the UK and partner country researchers and institutions. They should also explore 
any potential longer term benefit that might arise, thinking about who might benefit and how 
they might benefit and describing the actions that will be taken to ensure that potential 
impact is realised.

2. Overview of the funding opportunity 
Researcher Links Workshop grants are designed to provide financial support to bring together a 
UK/partner country bilateral cohort of early career researchers to take part in workshops to meet 
the overarching objectives. The programme is supported by UK government and partner country 
funding 
and 
forms 
part 
of 
the 
Newton 
Fund 
(http://www.britishcouncil.org/education/science/researcher-links). 
Each workshop will be co-ordinated by two Leading Researchers1, one from each country, and 
will focus either on a specific research area or on an interdisciplinary theme (for example 
‘Sustainable Cities’). Workshop co-ordinators can identify up to four additional Leading or 
Established Researchers1 (two from each country) to be involved in the workshop and act as 
mentors, but the remaining participants must be researchers at an earlier stage in their career. 
Proposals in any discipline/multidisciplinary area will be accepted (including the natural sciences, 
social sciences, and arts and humanities). However, some countries have specified priority 
research areas (see Appendix 1 for country specific guidance). 
Not-for-profit higher education institutions or publicly-funded research organisations can 
participate in Researcher Links workshops. For-profit organisations and not-for-profit 
organisations can participate but are usually not eligible to apply for Workshop grants. For-profit 
organisations are not eligible to receive any grant funds. Please see list of eligible UK 
research institutions here. Please contact us at UK-Researcherlinks@britishcouncil.org if you are 
in doubt about the eligibility of your institution. 
UK institutions can partner with institutions affiliated to other UK institutions, (e.g. an overseas 
campus) to deliver workshops provided that the workshops also include other eligible higher 
education institutions or research organisations in the partner country. Applicants will need to 
work closely with and include early career researchers from the institutions based in the partner 
country that are not affiliated to a UK university. 
In the April 2017 call the following countries are inviting proposals for Researcher Links 
workshops: 
 
Brazil 
 
India 
 
Kenya 
 
Malaysia 
 
South Africa 
 
Thailand 
 
Vietnam  
Please note that subsequent calls for proposals may involve different partner countries. 
3. Relevance to economic development and social welfare 
Researcher Links Workshops are intended to support research areas relevant to the 
development of partner countries. 
We define research with development relevance as research (applied or fundamental) that has 
the potential to contribute to the economic development and social welfare of low- and 
                                                
1 For an indication of profiles for the different categories of participants, we suggest applicants refer to the European 
Commission document ‘Towards a European framework for research careers’ 
https://cdn5.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/policy_library/towards_a_european_framework_for_research_careers_final.pdf. 
Co-ordinators and mentors should be at ‘R4 – Leading Researcher’ level or ‘R3 – Established Researcher’ level, and early 
career participants at ‘R2 –Recognised Researcher’ level or at the beginning of R3 level.

middle- income countries2, benefitting low income and vulnerable populations in these countries. 
In order to be considered for funding under this programme, all proposals must clearly 
articulate a plausible pathway showing how the research may lead to positive impact on 
these populations within a reasonable timeframe (within 3–15 years). Applications which 
do not meet this criterion cannot receive UK Newton Fund support. 
In some disciplines, development relevance can be longer-term and less direct than in other 
areas and impact may be societal. In all cases, it is the responsibility of the applicant to articulate 
how the research area or activity proposed will meet these criteria. Applicants should not expect 
reviewers to make assumptions about development impact that is not clearly described within the 
proposal. 
In order to show development relevance within the context of their proposed project, applicants 
are encouraged to include reference to any local or national consultation, links to government 
policies, and any links with government institutions. 
For more on our approach to ODA, please see http://www.newtonfund.ac.uk/about/what-is-oda/. 
Agreements for ownership and exploitation of intellectual property generated through project 
activities must be consistent with the primary aim of addressing development issues. 
Under this call, the following research and innovation challenge areas will be given priority 
(unless specified further in Appendix 1 for individual countries). Multidisciplinary proposals 
are welcome, and may include social sciences and arts and humanities. The challenge areas are 
as follows: 
 
Agriculture, (e.g. irrigation, crop yields) 
 
Climate and environment, (e.g. climate change, green technology, sustainable development, 
ecosystem services, resource scarcity) 
 
Sustainable energy for all 
 
Education research for development 
 
Economic growth, (e.g. equitable growth, financial sector development, private sector 
development) 
 
Health, (e.g. HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases, child mortality, 
maternal health) 
 
Water and sanitation 
 
Food and nutrition (including food security) 
 
Demographic change and migration 
 
Rural and urban development 
 
Infrastructure (including civil engineering, information and communication technologies, big 
data for social and economic development) 
 
Humanitarian disasters and emergencies, disaster risk reduction 
 
Resilient and connected communities 
 
Governance, society and conflict, (e.g. transparency, accountability, effective institutions, 
land and natural resource rights, poverty alleviation, social development, structural 
inequalities, violence and security, peace building, civil society) 
 
Development-relevant data collection, quality and access (including administrative data and 
macroeconomic statistics).

5. Location of the workshops 
It is expected that most workshops will take place in the partner country, (i.e. outside of the UK) 
unless indicated otherwise in Appendix 1. However, if there is a compelling reason for the 
workshop to take place in the UK, then this should be detailed in the proposal and agreed with 
the British Council. 
6. Duration of the workshops 
The minimum duration of a workshop is three (3) days and the maximum duration is five (5) days. 
7. Timing of the workshops 
Workshops must take place between 01 February 2018 and 31 January 2019. 
8. Participation in the workshops 
The two workshop co-ordinators must identify up to 4 Leading/Established Researchers (see 
footnote on page 1 for a definition), two from each country, to act as mentors, but the remaining 
participants must be researchers at an earlier stage in their career. The maximum number of 
participants per workshop is 40 (including co-ordinators, mentors and early career researchers). 
Participants must be based in the UK or in the partner country. 
Workshop places must be allocated to early career researchers through an open call once the 
British Council has notified the applicants that their proposal has been successful. Criteria for the 
selection of early career researchers will be made available to workshop co-ordinators. However, 
we would expect early career researchers to have been awarded their PhD not more than 10 
years prior to the workshop (or to have equivalent experience), with allowances made for career 
breaks. If a researcher does not hold a PhD but has research experience equivalent to a PhD 
holder and works in a field where a PhD is not a prerequisite for established research activity, 
they can still be considered eligible. Participants from for-profit organisations cannot be funded. 
Role of the workshop co-ordinators: Co-ordinators submit the online application form along 
with a budget request, determine the workshop theme and shape the content/agenda of the 
workshop. Workshop co-ordinators – overseen by the relevant British Council country office and 
in-country partners, if appropriate – will also be responsible for selecting early career researchers 
to participate in the workshop if the proposal is successful. 
Under this call for proposals, workshop co-ordinators will be responsible for all organisational 
aspects of the workshop logistics (including travel arrangements for participants and booking of 
the workshop venue). 
In most cases, the grant agreement will be signed by the UK workshop co-ordinator’s home 
institution which will be responsible for the management of the grant (including financial 
reporting). However, in some countries this is subject to change and the final terms will be 
communicated to successful applicants. 
Role of the Mentors: Established Researchers can give a limited number of keynote lectures but 
must also act as mentors to the early career researchers during the workshop. Ideally, they would 
also remain in contact with the early career researchers after the workshop has finished. 
9. Language 
Workshops will be held in English. It is expected that all participants will have a sufficient 
standard of English to engage fully in discussion. However, consideration should be given to 
non-native speakers. 
10. Thematic focus of the workshops 
Workshops may be specific to a particular field of research or interdisciplinary in nature. Any 
relevant field of research can be covered, except where partner countries have indicated specific 
priority areas (please see Appendix 1 for country priority areas).

11. Content of the workshop 
Workshop co-ordinators are expected to lead on developing the research content of the 
workshops. However, workshops are intended to be a career development opportunity with a 
focus on promoting international collaboration, and there are specific guidelines to facilitate this. 
The following is a brief overview, and more detailed guidance will be provided to successful 
applicants: 
Sessions should be as interactive as possible, and all participants encouraged to share 
knowledge, experience and ideas. Workshop co-ordinators and mentors should share their 
expertise. 
Suggested sessions: 
 
Formal keynote lectures by the workshop co-ordinators and mentors. These must take up no 
more than a half-day in total (ideally spread over the workshop). 
 
Research sessions where the early career researchers are able to share their current 
research. This could be in poster format or oral presentations. 
 
Networking sessions where researchers are able to interact and explore opportunities for 
collaboration, (e.g. speed-networking sessions). 
 
Overview of the research base and funding opportunities: a brief introduction to the research 
base in the UK and partner country – how research is funded, size, strengths, international 
collaborative activity and links with industry. 
 
Career development opportunities in the UK and partner country. This could be an informal 
discussion amongst the researchers or a more structured look at career development. 
 
How to form international collaborations (intercultural skills, challenges, opportunities, best 
practice, etc.). 
 
Optional content within workshops (where appropriate these sessions would be welcome but 
applications will not be disadvantaged if they do not include them): 
 
Depending on the research field or theme of the workshop, co-ordinators may wish to 
include a session which invites industry or other non-academic partners to talk about 
cross-sector collaboration. 
 
Public engagement activity/visit to a relevant research facility. 
12. Recruitment of participants 
Following the selection process, successful workshop co-ordinators will be responsible for 
recruiting participants to the workshops. Participants must be based in the UK or in the partner 
country. 
Early career researchers recruited to participate in the workshop must have a PhD or equivalent 
research experience. There must be an open call for participants which must be disseminated 
through various defined channels3 (so that workshops are advertised as widely as possible). No 
more than a third of early career researchers from each country may be recruited from within 
the institutions of the co-ordinators and mentors.

The selection of early career researchers to participate in the workshop must be fair and 
transparent. The British Council will provide a template application form for participants which 
co-ordinators can adapt as appropriate, and British Council in-country teams will be available to 
offer advice and oversight where necessary. 
The maximum number of participants per workshop is 40 (including co-ordinators, mentors and 
ECRs). 
Equal opportunities and diversity are at the heart of the British Council’s cultural relations 
ambitions. Co-ordinators are encouraged to work towards as equal a gender balance as 
possible, promote diversity, and ensure that no applicants are excluded from participation on the 
basis of ethnicity, gender, religious belief, sexual orientation or disability. 
13. Funding 
The level of grant funding available from the Newton Fund depends on the country: please see 
Appendix 1 for country-specific limits. 
A condition for accessing funds from the Newton Researcher Links programme is that match 
funding is secured from partners in some countries. For the April 2017 call, the British Council 
has secured match funding from most national funding agencies or other partners in each 
participating country. Please see Appendix 1 for more details for each country. 
The grant contribution given to support the organisation of the Researcher Links workshops is 
calculated using a combination of flat unit rates per person and accountable costs. 
Researchers and their institutions will be asked to keep and submit receipts and invoices to 
demonstrate their spend until 31 December 2022. 
Full checks of supporting documentation will be carried out on a proportion of the grants. 
Further monitoring and evaluation will also be carried out, to be specified in the grant agreement. 
There are five budget categories: International travel, Domestic travel, Subsistence, Event costs 
per day and Additional workshop costs. 
Please see Appendix 1 for maximum amounts that can be requested in each budget 
category. Applicants are required to provide a budget request upon submission of their proposal.  
International travel 
This is a contribution towards: travel costs to the country of the workshop visa costs, travel 
insurance and local transport to the workshop venue for international participants. It is calculated 
using a unit cost for each workshop participant, at the travel rate stated for the country where the 
workshop takes place.4 International economy class airfares should be booked by the workshop 
co-ordinators as far in advance as possible to minimise costs. 
Workshop co-ordinators and workshop participants must take out adequate insurance. The 
British Council cannot take responsibility for any issues which occur when the participants are 
in-country. 
Domestic travel 
This covers costs of domestic travel to the venue for workshop participants based in the country 
where the workshop takes place. The domestic travel contribution is calculated using a unit cost 
for each workshop participant and is specific to the country where the workshop takes place. 
Subsistence 
This covers the costs of accommodation, medical insurance and daily expenses such as phone 
and local transport. Subsistence is calculated using a unit cost for each workshop participant 
                                                
4Costs of any additional travel during the workshop – for international and domestic participants – may be 
covered using the subsistence budget.

multiplied by the number of days of the workshop, and is specific to the country where the 
workshop takes place. 
Event costs 
This covers the costs of venue hire and meals. The event rate grant contribution is calculated 
using a unit cost for each workshop participant multiplied by the number of days of the workshop, 
and is specific to the country where the workshop takes place. 
Contribution to additional workshop costs 
Workshop co-ordinators can request a sum to cover: 
 
Additional event costs not already covered, e.g. projector, flip charts and other materials 
needed for the organisation of the workshops (including networking and social activities). 
 
Administrative costs such as communications cost, printing costs and stationery. 
Staff costs and honoraria cannot be covered by the Researcher Links grants. 
Payment of the grant 
The Newton Fund grant for Researcher Links workshops will be paid in 2 instalments: a 90% 
pre-financing payment will be paid within 30 days of signature of the Grant Agreement, and 10% 
post-workshop payment, or a recovery, on approval by the British Council of a final report 
submitted by the workshop coordinators. If the workshop has not been delivered as planned, or if 
fewer participants attended than originally envisaged, resulting in a reduction in costs, the final 
payment may be withheld and if necessary a proportion of the grant recovered.  
The Researcher Links Grant Agreement will be signed by and the grant paid to one of the 
workshop co-ordinators’ home institutions, usually the UK. The grant recipient institution that 
signs the agreement will then be responsible for the management of the grant (including financial 
reporting). The final terms will be communicated to successful applicants. 
Funding offered under the Researcher Links programme is intended as a contribution towards 
the costs of the workshops. Workshop co-ordinators are expected to add a contribution in-kind 
towards the overall cost of the workshop by dedicating their time to the planning and delivery of 
the workshops. 
14. Reporting 
Workshop co-ordinators must submit a final report within 30 days after the workshop as a 
condition of the grant. The final report template will be sent to successful applicants as part of the 
grant agreement and will include financial and narrative sections. Further details will also be 
provided to successful applicants in the detailed workshop guidelines. 
Individual workshop participants will be asked to complete an online baseline survey, a baseline 
follow up survey six months after the workshop and a post workshop feedback questionnaire. 
Workshop co-ordinators will be asked to send the link to the baseline survey to their participants 
and also to administer the post-workshop questionnaire. 
15. Ethics and research governance 
It is essential that all legal and professional codes of practice are followed in conducting work 
supported under this Programme. Applicants must ensure the proposed activity will be carried out 
to the highest standards of ethics and research integrity. Specifically, applications that involve 
research on animals, human participants, human tissue or patient/participant data must be 
accompanied by necessary permission certificates from the relevant local ethical review 
committees/authorities in the UK and the partner country, or an undertaking to obtain this 
permission in advance of the activity commencing. Failure to do so will result in applications 
being rendered ineligible and any funding already committed through this Programme being 
rescinded.

APPENDIX 1: COUNTRY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE AND GRANT 
RATES 
Please note that the unit costs given below constitute the maximum mounts that can be 
requested in each category and that all budget requests will be assessed for feasibility and 
appropriateness. While the maximum contribution cannot be exceeded, applicants can request 
less in which case the amount requested cannot be increased at a later stage. 
 
Calculating your budget request 
To calculate the budget contribution that can be requested in each category, applicants should 
use the unit costs for each country where the workshop takes place, please refer to country 
specific grant rates tables in this Appendix 1. 
International travel unit rates and visa costs should be multiplied by the number of international 
participants. 
Domestic travel unit rates should be multiplied by the number of domestic participants. 
Subsistence should be multiplied by the combined number of International and domestic 
participants and by the number of days the workshop lasts. 
Additional workshop costs must be a maximum of £2200. 
EXAMPLE: The budget for a workshop lasting 4 days and taking place in a partner 
country attended by 20 UK-based researchers and 20 researchers based in the partner 
country would be calculated as follows: 
20 X £1200 (international travel) = £24000 
20 X £150 (domestic travel) = £3000 
40 X £100 (subsistence costs) = £4000 X 4 days (duration of the workshop) = £16000 
40 X £30 (event rate) = £1200 X 4 days (duration of the workshop) = £4800 
£2200 (additional workshop costs) 
= £50,000 total maximum contribution that can be requested.

3. KENYA 
 
National co-funder: 
National Research Fund (NRF)                   
             
Research priorities: 
The Newton Utafiti Fund programme encourages 
transformative and collaborative research purposefully 
developed to add value and create synergy to existing sectoral 
and other initiatives of government and partners to national 
priorities as well as contribute to meet the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). 
The priority areas of focus for Kenya during this second call 
have been identified as: 
1) 
Food Security 
Population growth and increasing consumption trends are 
posing a major burden to County’s limited resources.  The 
increasing population migrations from rural to urban areas and 
occasional droughts have continued to impact agricultural 
productivity. About 10 million people in Kenya suffer from 
chronic food insecurity and poor nutrition, and between two 
and four million people require food assistance at any given 
time. Nearly 30% of Kenya’s children can be classified as 
undernourished, and micronutrient deficiencies are 
widespread. 
Kenya Government is committed to building self-reliance to 
reduce chronic food insecurity, as well as measures to assist 
those in needs with a view of longer-term development efforts 
to mitigate the potential impact of future emergencies. The 
Vision 2030, Second Medium Term Plan (2013-2017) and the 
Food and Nutrition Security Policy (FNSP) provides a 
framework for multiple dimensions to food security and nutrition 
improvement. It recognizes the need for multi-public and 
private sectors involvement, and that hunger eradication and 
nutrition improvement to be a shared responsibility of all 
Kenyans. This is also with the is aspirations of Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) particularly Goal Number two 
targeting to end hunger, achieve food security and improved 
nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.  
2) 
Sustainable and Renewable Energy 
 NEWTON FUND RESEARCHER LINKS WORKSHOPS – GUIDELINES FOR APPLICANTS 
APRIL 2017 VERSION 0.8 
16 
 
Access to sustainable energy is a necessary precondition for 
achieving national development goals such as poverty 
eradication, access to clean water, improved public health and 
education, women's empowerment and increase food 
production. The country is straining to achieve the set target for 
the Sustainable Energy for all by 2030.  
Over 80% of Kenyans rely on the traditional use of biomass as 
the primary source of energy for cooking and heating. This is a 
challenge the Kenyan government is putting in place measures 
to regulate the fuel wood sector to reverse the trend. 
Researchers are invited under this Newton Utafiti Fund 
programme to come up with multidisciplinary research 
concepts to address issues of access to sustainable and 
renewable Energy with special emphasis to rural communities.  
3) 
Health 
The government of Kenya recognizes that achieving the 
development goals outlined in Kenya Vision 2030 will require 
increasing productivity. The health sector is expected to play a 
critical supportive role in maintaining a healthy workforce which 
is necessary for the increased labour production that Kenya 
requires in order to match its global competitors.  Therefore, 
health is one of the key components in delivering the social 
pillar for the Kenya Vision 2030. The country has developed a 
number of strategies to address the health challenges. The 
Constitution of Kenya (2010) introduced a transformational 
change in governance and public administration, providing for 
the Right to Health for every Kenyan, and a devolved system of 
governance. The Kenya Health Policy (2014-2030) has defined 
a comprehensive set of policy objectives and orientations to be 
attained in order to accelerate improvements in the health of 
Kenyans.  
In this call researchers in Health sector are invited to contribute 
in facilitating the aspirations of Kenya development blue print 
Vision 2030, Health Policy, Attainment of SDG No. 3 on 
ensuring healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all and other 
relevant sectoral policy documents.  
4) 
Environment and Climate Change 
Kenya recognizes the value of her environmental resources 
and that the degradation of the environment can adversely 
affect productivity and increase levels of poverty in the country.  
The conservation and sustainable use of land, water, forests, 
biological and mineral resources are key to the country’s 
development objectives.  The rate of exploitation of the 
country’s land and biological resources is considered 
unsustainable. Natural ecosystems, important for a number of 
natural services and products are being converted to other 
uses or face the threat of degradation due to pollution.  
It is worth noting that enhanced emission of greenhouse gases 
into the atmosphere has led to global warming and climatic 
change, and the changes to the earth surface through various 
human activities, including waste disposal, has contributed to 
global environmental change, the local magnitude and potential 
impact of which is yet to be established. To the Government of 
 NEWTON FUND RESEARCHER LINKS WORKSHOPS – GUIDELINES FOR APPLICANTS 
APRIL 2017 VERSION 0.8 
17 
 
Kenya, these changes pose both potential risks and 
opportunities for food production, human health and energy 
availability, among many others. Multi-sectoral and 
multidisciplinary research proposals are invited to contribute in 
reverse these challenges and alleviate climate change 
adversities.   
5) 
Manufacturing for SMEs 
Over the past few years the level of Government interests in 
entrepreneurship and small business development as potential 
solutions to flagging economic growth and rising 
unemployment has increased. Kenya’s manufacturing sector is 
identified as among the key productive sectors identified for 
economic growth and development because of its immense 
potential for wealth, employment creation and poverty 
alleviation. Kenya Vision 2030, Second Medium Term 
underscores the importance of this sector to the economy. 
The SMEs are well recognized for their operation cutting 
across almost all sectors of the economy and sustain majority 
of households in Kenya.  The sector employs significant 
number of employees and is currently receiving a lot of 
Government attention as it’s seen as the solution to the 
crippling unemployment especially for the youth. 
Transformative research targeting manufacturing for SMEs is 
highly welcome. 
6) 
Governance and Conflict resolution related to 
development 
Kenya recognizes that Governance, peace and security of 
humankind is an international concern. It requires the 
development of partnerships between public agencies, local 
communities, civil society and various related actors. The 
National Policy on Peace building and Conflict Management 
provides platform to address the key challenges facing Kenya 
in her commitment to supporting sustainable peace and 
development.  
In this programme, researchers are being invited to develop 
multi-sectoral approaches to enhance institutional framework 
for conflict management and Peace building that fosters strong 
partnerships between the Government, the market, the civil 
society, Development partners and grass root communities for 
sustainable development. 
7) 
Cross-Cutting Issues
