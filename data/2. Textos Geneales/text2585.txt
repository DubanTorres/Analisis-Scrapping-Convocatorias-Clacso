Introduction 
This part of the Work Programme contributes to developing the new knowledge and 
enhancing the skills of people behind research and innovation, this being one of the key 
drivers identified in the strategy for the first three years of Horizon 2020. 
The Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions ensure excellent and innovative research training as 
well as attractive career and knowledge-exchange opportunities through cross-border and 
cross-sector mobility of researchers, to better prepare them for current and future societal 
challenges. 
The Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions are open to all domains of research and innovation 
addressed under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, from basic research up 
to market take-up and innovation services1. Research and innovation fields as well as sectors 
are chosen freely by the applicants in a fully bottom-up manner. 
The Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions are open to researchers and innovation staff at all stages 
of their career, irrespective of age. They are open to universities, research institutions, 
research infrastructures, businesses, and other socio-economic actors, including civil society 
organisations, from all countries, including third countries under the conditions defined in the 
Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013 and in part A of the General 
Annexes to the Work Programme. Attention is paid to encouraging the strong participation of 
industry, in particular SMEs, for the successful implementation and impact of the Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
The Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions support researchers to establish themselves on a more 
stable career path and to ensure that they can achieve an appropriate work/life balance, taking 
into account their family situation. 
Mobility is a key requirement in the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. Researchers receive 
funding on the condition that they move from one country to another to broaden or deepen 
their competences. 
The principles of the European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the 
Recruitment of Researchers2 (Charter and Code) promoting open recruitment and attractive 
working and employment conditions should be applied by all the funded participants. 
Principles of research integrity - as set out, for instance, in the European Code of Conduct for 
Research Integrity – will apply throughout all Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
                                                 
 
1     Proposals falling within the scope of the Annex I of the Euratom Treaty shall be submitted to relevant calls under 
the Euratom Framework Programme. 
2     Commission Recommendation of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of 
Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers, C(2005) 576 of 11.3.2005. 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 5 of 72 
 
The Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions endorse the Horizon 2020 Responsible Research and 
Innovation (RRI) cross-cutting issue, engaging society, integrating the gender and ethical 
dimensions, ensuring the access to research outcomes and encouraging formal and informal 
science education. All applicants to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie calls are encouraged to 
adopt an RRI approach into their proposals. 
The ethical dimension of the activities undertaken should be analysed and taken into account, 
including relevant socio-economic implications. This implies the respect of ethical principles 
and related legislation during the implementation. Whenever possible, the activities should 
also include in their objectives a better understanding and handling of the ethical aspects as 
well as the promotion of the highest ethical standards in the field and among the actors and 
stakeholders. 
The Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions pay particular attention to gender balance. In line with 
the Charter and Code, all Marie Skłodowska-Curie proposals are encouraged to take 
appropriate measures to facilitate mobility and counter-act gender-related barriers to it. Equal 
opportunities are to be ensured in the implementation of the actions by a balanced 
participation of women and men, both at the level of supported researchers and that of 
decision-making/supervision/management structure. In research activities where human 
beings are involved as subjects or end-users, gender differences may exist. In these cases the 
gender dimension in the research content has to be addressed as an integral part of the 
proposal to ensure the highest level of scientific quality. 
As training researchers on gender issues serves the policy objectives of Horizon 2020 and is 
necessary for the implementation of R&I actions, applicants may include in their proposals 
such activity. 
To further enhance dissemination and public engagement, beneficiaries of the Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie actions are required to plan suitable public outreach activities. In this way, 
they can also contribute to the cross-cutting objectives of Horizon 2020, such as climate 
action, sustainable development and biodiversity. 
The following applies for all calls with opening dates falling between 14/10/2015 and 
25/07/2016 inclusive: 
A novelty in Horizon 2020 is the Pilot on Open Research Data which aims to improve and 
maximise access to and re-use of research data generated by projects. Applicants to the Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie actions may participate in the Open Research Data Pilot on a voluntary 
basis. Participation in the Pilot is not taken into account during the evaluation procedure. In 
other words, proposals will not be evaluated favourably because they are part of the Pilot. 
More information can be found under General Annex L of the work programme. 
A further new element in Horizon 2020 is the use of Data Management Plans (DMPs) 
detailing what data the project will generate, whether and how it will be exploited or made 
accessible for verification and re-use, and how it will be curated and preserved. The use of a 
DMP is required for projects participating in the Open Research Data Pilot. Other projects are 
invited to submit a DMP if relevant for their planned research. Only funded projects are 
required to submit a DMP.

Further guidance on the Pilot on Open Research Data and Data Management is available on 
the Participant Portal. 
The following applies for all calls with an opening date on or after 26/07/2016: 
Grant beneficiaries under this work programme part will engage in research data sharing by 
default, as stipulated under Article 29.3 of the Horizon 2020 Model Grant Agreement 
(including the creation of a Data Management Plan). Participants may however opt out of 
these arrangements, both before and after the signature of the grant agreement. More 
information can be found under General Annex L of the work programme.

 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks 
H2020-MSCA-ITN-2016 
MSCA-ITN-2016:  Innovative Training Networks 
Objective: The Innovative Training Networks (ITN) aim to train a new generation of creative, 
entrepreneurial and innovative early-stage researchers, able to face current and future 
challenges and to convert knowledge and ideas into products and services for economic and 
social benefit. 
ITN will raise excellence and structure research and doctoral training, extending the 
traditional academic research training setting, incorporating the elements of Open Science and 
equipping researchers with the right combination of research-related and transferable 
competences. It will provide enhanced career perspectives in both the academic and non-
academic sectors through international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility combined 
with an innovation-oriented mind-set. 
Scope: ITN supports competitively selected joint research training and/or doctoral 
programmes, implemented by partnerships of universities, research institutions, research 
infrastructures, businesses, SMEs, and other socio-economic actors from different countries 
across Europe and beyond. 
Partnerships take the form of collaborative European Training Networks (ETN), European 
Industrial Doctorates (EID) or European Joint Doctorates (EJD). 
Each programme should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-
wide training and establishing active and continuous communication and exchange of best 
practice among the partners to maximise the benefits of the partnership. 
The programme should exploit complementary competences of the participating 
organisations, and enable sharing of knowledge, networking activities, the organisation of 
workshops and conferences. 
Training responds to well identified needs in defined research areas, with appropriate 
references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follows the EU Principles for Innovative 
Doctoral Training. It should be primarily focused on scientific and technological knowledge 
through research on individual, personalised projects. 
In order to increase the employability of the researchers, the research training should be 
complemented by the meaningful exposure of each researcher to the non-academic sector. 
Secondments of the researcher to other beneficiaries and partner organisations are 
encouraged. 
Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills 
common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and 
entrepreneurship will be supported.

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 8 of 72 
 
In order to reflect on the changing nature of research, training should prepare early-stage 
researchers for an increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by 
new technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, open access, raw data, etc.). 
A Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the early-
stage researcher recruited by the selected network. In addition to research objectives, this plan 
comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including planning for publications and 
participation in conferences. 
Attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career 
guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for EJD and for EID, and 
encouraged in ETN. In EID, the joint supervision of the researcher must be ensured by at least 
one supervisor from the academic sector and one supervisor from the non-academic sector. 
These arrangements will be taken into account during the evaluation of the proposal. 
In EID and EJD, fellowships offered to early-stage researchers should lead to a doctoral 
degree. EJD result in joint3, double or multiple doctoral degrees4 awarded by institutions from 
at least two different countries. 
In EID and EJD, enrolment in a doctoral programme and the creation of a joint governance 
structure - with joint admission (EJD only), selection, supervision, monitoring and assessment 
procedures - is mandatory. These arrangements will be taken into account during the 
evaluation of the proposal.

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships 
H2020-MSCA-IF-2016 
MSCA-IF-2016:  
Individual Fellowships 
Objective: The goal of the Individual Fellowships is to enhance the creative and innovative 
potential of experienced researchers, wishing to diversify their individual competence in 
terms of skill acquisition through advanced training, international and intersectoral mobility. 
Individual Fellowships provide opportunities to acquire and transfer new knowledge and to 
work on research and innovation in a European context (EU Member States and Associated 
Countries) or outside Europe. The scheme particularly supports the return and reintegration of 
researchers from outside Europe who have previously worked here. It also develops or helps 
to restart the careers of individual researchers that show great potential, considering their 
experience. 
Scope: Support is foreseen for individual, trans-national fellowships awarded to the best or 
most promising researchers of any nationality, for employment in EU Member States or 
Associated Countries. It is based on an application made jointly by the researcher and the 
beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sectors. 
Only one proposal per individual researcher will be evaluated. 
Fellowships take the form of European Fellowships or Global Fellowships. European 
Fellowships are held in EU Member States or Associated Countries and are open to 
researchers either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. 
The researcher must comply with the rules of mobility in the country where the European 
Fellowship is held. 
Return and reintegration of researchers into a longer term research position in Europe, 
including in their country of origin, is supported via a separate multi-disciplinary reintegration 
panel of the European Fellowships. For the reintegration panel, there shall be mobility into 
Europe. 
Support to individuals to resume research in Europe after a career break, e.g. after parental 
leave, is ensured via a separate multi-disciplinary career restart panel of the European 
Fellowships. To qualify for the career restart panel, researchers must not have been active in 
research for at least 12 months immediately prior to the deadline for submission. 
Researchers seeking to work on research and innovation projects in an organisation from the 
non-academic sector will be supported via a separate multi-disciplinary society and enterprise 
panel of the European Fellowships. The objective of this panel is to facilitate career moves 
between the academic and non-academic sectors and to open attractive career opportunities 
for researchers outside academia. 
Global Fellowships are based on a secondment to a third country and a mandatory 12 month 
return period to a European host. The researcher must comply with the rules of mobility in the 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 13 of 72 
 
country where the Global Fellowship secondment takes place, not for the country of the return 
phase. 
Researchers receiving an Individual Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase in 
Europe, notably in the non-academic sector, within the overall duration of their fellowship. 
For a fellowship of 18 months or less, the secondment phase may last up to three months. For 
a fellowship of more than 18 months, the secondment phase may last up to six months. The 
secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. The 
secondment should significantly add to the impact of the fellowship. 
A Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the 
researcher. In addition to research or innovation objectives, this plan comprises the 
researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, planning for 
publications and participation in conferences. 
Expected Impact: 
At researcher level: 
 Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved 
employability and career prospects both in and outside academia   
 Increase in higher impact R&I output, more knowledge and ideas converted into 
products and services   
 Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society  
At organisation level:   
 Enhanced cooperation and stronger networks   
 Better transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines   
 Boosting of R&I capacity among participating organisations  
At system level:   
 Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers in 
Europe   
 Strengthening of Europe's human capital base in R&I with more entrepreneurial and 
better trained researchers   
 Better communication of R&I results to society   
 Increase in Europe's attractiveness as a leading destination for R&I   
 Better quality research and innovation contributing to Europe's competitiveness and 
growth

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange 
H2020-MSCA-RISE-2016 
MSCA-RISE-2016:  Research and Innovation Staff Exchange 
Objective: The RISE scheme will promote international and inter-sector collaboration through 
research and innovation staff exchanges, and sharing of knowledge and ideas from research to 
market (and vice-versa). 
The scheme fosters a shared culture of research and innovation that welcomes and rewards 
creativity and entrepreneurship and helps to turn creative ideas into innovative products, 
services or processes. 
Scope: RISE involves organisations from the academic and non-academic sectors (in 
particular SMEs), based in Europe (EU Member States and Associated Countries) and outside 
Europe (third countries). 
Support is provided for the development of partnerships in the form of a joint research and 
innovation project. This is aimed at knowledge sharing via international as well as 
intersectoral mobility, based on secondments of research and innovation staff (exchanges) 
with an in-built return mechanism. 
The organisations constituting the partnership contribute directly to the implementation of a 
joint research and innovation project by seconding and/or hosting eligible staff members. 
Secondments shall always take place between legal entities independent from each other7. 
RISE should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations, as well 
as other synergies, and enable networking activities, organisation of workshops and 
conferences to facilitate sharing of knowledge, new skills acquisition and career development 
for research and innovation staff members. 
RISE projects can focus either on one dimension of mobility (intersectoral / international), or 
include a combination of both. 
Exchanges can be for both early-stage and experienced researchers' levels and can also 
include administrative, managerial and technical staff directly involved in the research and 
innovation activities of the proposal. 
Support for the exchanges between institutions within Europe (EU Member States and 
Associated Countries) covers only intersectoral secondments.

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Co-funding of regional, national and international 
programmes 
H2020-MSCA-COFUND-2016 
MSCA-COFUND-2016:  
Co-funding 
of 
regional, 
national 
and 
international 
programmes 
Objective: The COFUND scheme aims to stimulate regional, national or international 
programmes to foster excellence in researchers' training, mobility and career development, 
spreading the best practices of Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
This will be achieved by co-funding new or existing regional, national, and international 
programmes to open up to, and provide for, international, intersectoral and interdisciplinary 
research training, as well as transnational and cross-sectoral mobility of researchers at all 
stages of their career. 
Scope: Each proposal funded under the COFUND scheme shall have a sole beneficiary that 
will be responsible for the availability of the necessary matching funds to execute the 
proposal. 
Applicants submit multi-annual proposals for new or existing doctoral programmes or 
fellowship programmes which are expected to have an impact on enhancing research- and 
innovation related human resources on regional, national or international level. 
Applicants having benefited from COFUND under previous calls (under the Seventh 
Framework Programme or under Horizon 2020) will explain how their proposal adds value in 
relation to previous grant(s). This can also take the form of increased networking with 
organisations in less represented countries or capacity building measures there. 
Researchers supported under this scheme shall comply with the mobility rules of the Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
Limitations regarding the researchers' origin and destination should be avoided. Support 
cannot be awarded to researchers who are already permanently employed by the organisation 
hosting them. 
Proposed programmes are encouraged to cover all research disciplines ("bottom-up"), but can 
also focus on specific disciplines. In this case the range of covered disciplines should allow 
reasonable flexibility for the researchers. 
Programmes that prioritise specific research disciplines based on national or regional 
Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies) can also be 
supported. Synergies with the European Structural & Investment Funds (ESIF) are 
encouraged. 
COFUND takes the form of: 
A) Doctoral programmes 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 21 of 72 
 
Doctoral programmes address the development and broadening of the research competencies 
of early-stage researchers. The training follows the EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral 
Training. Collaboration with a wider set of partner organisations, including from the non-
academic sector, which may provide hosting or secondment opportunities or training in 
research or transferable skills, as well as innovative elements of the proposed programme, will 
be positively taken into account during the evaluation. 
Each researcher must be enrolled in a doctoral programme. Attention is paid to the quality of 
supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. 
B) Fellowship programmes 
Fellowship programmes fund individual research training and career development fellowships 
for experienced researchers. The programmes supported should have regular selection rounds 
following fixed deadlines or regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between the 
researchers applying. The selections should be based on open, widely advertised competition, 
with transparent international peer review and the selection of candidates on merit. Mobility 
types supported by fellowship programmes may be similar to the ones supported under Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships. On top of transnational mobility, applicants are 
encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility into their programmes. Fellowship 
programmes should be based on individual-driven mobility, i.e., researchers should be able to 
freely choose a research topic and the appropriate organisation to host them, fitting their 
individual needs. 
Given that the aim of the co-funded fellowship programmes is the support of individual 
fellows, research teams will not be funded. 
Expected Impact: 
At researcher level:   
 Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved 
employability and career prospects both in and outside academia (leading in the longer-
term to more successful careers)   
 Increase in higher impact R&I output, more knowledge and ideas converted into 
products and services   
 Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society  
At organisation level:   
 Development of high quality human resources   
 Boosting R&I capacity among participating organisations   
 Enhanced cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines   
 Strengthening of international and intersectoral collaborative networks  
At system level:   
 Aligning of practices and policies in the context of the EU Human Resources Strategy 
for Researchers, enhanced implementation of the European Charter and Code and the

European Researchers' Night 
H2020-MSCA-NIGHT-2016 
MSCA-NIGHT-2016:  
European Researchers' Night 
Objective: The European Researchers' Night aims to bring researchers closer to the general 
public and to increase awareness of research and innovation activities, with a view to 
supporting the public recognition of researchers, creating an understanding of the impact of 
researchers' work on citizen’s daily life, and encouraging young people to embark on research 
careers. 
Scope: The European Researchers' Night takes place yearly, typically on the last Friday of the 
month of September, and is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the 
promotion of research careers, in particular towards young people and their families. 
Supported events can start on Friday and last until early morning the following day. 
Activities focus on the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level 
of their scientific background, with a special focus on pupils and students. Activities can 
combine education aspects with entertainment, especially when addressing young audience. 
They can take various forms, e.g. hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, 
games, competitions, quizzes, etc. 
Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to 
encourage formal and informal science education with the aim to improve the scientific 
knowledge base. 
Each proposal should set up at least one European corner. Activities should be organised with 
researchers actively involved and directly in contact with the public. They should promote the 
European dimension and gender balance in research and innovation. Involvement of 
researchers funded by Horizon 2020, including the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions, is 
encouraged. 
Participants can be any legal entity in the EU Member States and Associated Countries, 
and/or if relevant, constitute a partnership at regional, national or international level. The 
maximum duration of support will be two years from the starting date specified in the grant 
agreement. Proposal should cover two editions of the Night, in successive years. One single 
edition of the Night may also be considered. 
Applicants not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of associated events. 
Expected Impact:    
 Increased awareness among the general public of the importance of research and 
innovation and more favourable general attitude towards its public funding   
 Better understanding of the key benefits that research brings to society   
 Reduction in the stereotypes about researchers and their profession   
 Increase, in the long term, of people taking up research careers

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks 
H2020-MSCA-ITN-2017 
MSCA-ITN-2017:  Innovative Training Networks 
Objective: The Innovative Training Networks (ITN) aim to train a new generation of creative, 
entrepreneurial and innovative early-stage researchers, able to face current and future 
challenges and to convert knowledge and ideas into products and services for economic and 
social benefit. 
ITN will raise excellence and structure research and doctoral training, extending the 
traditional academic research training setting, incorporating the elements of Open Science and 
equipping researchers with the right combination of research-related and transferable 
competences. It will provide enhanced career perspectives in both the academic and non-
academic sectors through international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility combined 
with an innovation-oriented mind-set. 
Scope: ITN supports competitively selected joint research training and/or doctoral 
programmes, implemented by partnerships of universities, research institutions, research 
infrastructures, businesses, SMEs, and other socio-economic actors from different countries 
across Europe and beyond. 
Partnerships take the form of collaborative European Training Networks (ETN), European 
Industrial Doctorates (EID) or European Joint Doctorates (EJD). 
Each programme should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-
wide training and establishing active and continuous communication and exchange of best 
practice among the partners to maximise the benefits of the partnership. 
The programme should exploit complementary competences of the participating 
organisations, and enable sharing of knowledge, networking activities, the organisation of 
workshops and conferences. 
Training responds to well identified needs in defined research areas, with appropriate 
references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follows the EU Principles for Innovative 
Doctoral Training. It should be primarily focused on scientific and technological knowledge 
through research on individual, personalised projects. 
In order to increase the employability of the researchers, the research training should be 
complemented by the meaningful exposure of each researcher to the non-academic sector. 
Secondments of the researcher to other beneficiaries and partner organisations are 
encouraged. 
Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills 
common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and 
entrepreneurship will be supported. 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 30 of 72 
 
In order to reflect on the changing nature of research, training should prepare early-stage 
researchers for an increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by 
new technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, open access, raw data, etc.). 
A Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the early-
stage researcher recruited by the selected network. In addition to research objectives, this plan 
comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including planning for publications and 
participation in conferences. 
Attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career 
guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for EJD and for EID, and 
encouraged in ETN. In EID, the joint supervision of the researcher must be ensured by at least 
one supervisor from the academic sector and one supervisor from the non-academic sector. 
These arrangements will be taken into account during the evaluation of the proposal. 
In EID and EJD, fellowships offered to early-stage researchers should lead to a doctoral 
degree. EJD result in joint11, double or multiple doctoral degrees12 awarded by institutions 
from at least two different countries. 
In EID and EJD, enrolment in a doctoral programme and the creation of a joint governance 
structure - with joint admission (EJD only), selection, supervision, monitoring and assessment 
procedures - is mandatory. These arrangements will be taken into account during the 
evaluation of the proposal. 
Expected Impact: 
At researcher level:   
 Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved 
employability and career prospects both in and outside academia (leading in the longer-
term to more successful careers)   
 Increase in higher impact R&I output and more knowledge and ideas converted into 
products and services

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships 
H2020-MSCA-IF-2017 
MSCA-IF-2017:  
Individual Fellowships 
Objective: The goal of the Individual Fellowships is to enhance the creative and innovative 
potential of experienced researchers, wishing to diversify their individual competence in 
terms of skill acquisition through advanced training, international and intersectoral mobility. 
Individual Fellowships provide opportunities to acquire and transfer new knowledge and to 
work on research and innovation in a European context (EU Member States and Associated 
Countries) or outside Europe. The scheme particularly supports the return and reintegration of 
researchers from outside Europe who have previously worked here. It also develops or helps 
to restart the careers of individual researchers that show great potential, considering their 
experience. 
Scope: Support is foreseen for individual, trans-national fellowships awarded to the best or 
most promising researchers of any nationality, for employment in EU Member States or 
Associated Countries. It is based on an application made jointly by the researcher and the 
beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sectors. 
Only one proposal per individual researcher will be evaluated. 
Fellowships take the form of European Fellowships or Global Fellowships. European 
Fellowships are held in EU Member States or Associated Countries and are open to 
researchers either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. 
The researcher must comply with the rules of mobility in the country where the European 
Fellowship is held. 
Return and reintegration of researchers into a longer term research position in Europe, 
including in their country of origin, is supported via a separate multi-disciplinary reintegration 
panel of the European Fellowships. For the reintegration panel, there shall be mobility into 
Europe. 
Support to individuals to resume research in Europe after a career break, e.g. after parental 
leave, is ensured via a separate multi-disciplinary career restart panel of the European 
Fellowships. To qualify for the career restart panel, researchers must not have been active in 
research for at least 12 months immediately prior to the deadline for submission. 
Researchers seeking to work on research and innovation projects in an organisation from the 
non-academic sector will be supported via a separate multi-disciplinary society and enterprise 
panel of the European Fellowships. The objective of this panel is to facilitate career moves 
between the academic and non-academic sectors and to open attractive career opportunities 
for researchers outside academia. 
Global Fellowships are based on a secondment to a third country and a mandatory 12 month 
return period to a European host. The researcher must comply with the rules of mobility in the 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 35 of 72 
 
country where the Global Fellowship secondment takes place, not for the country of the return 
phase. 
Researchers receiving an Individual Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase in 
Europe, notably in the non-academic sector, within the overall duration of their fellowship. 
For a fellowship of 18 months or less, the secondment phase may last up to three months. For 
a fellowship of more than 18 months, the secondment phase may last up to six months. The 
secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. The 
secondment should significantly add to the impact of the fellowship. 
A Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the 
researcher. In addition to research or innovation objectives, this plan comprises the 
researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, planning for 
publications and participation in conferences. 
Expected Impact: 
At researcher level:   
 Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved 
employability and career prospects both in and outside academia   
 Increase in higher impact R&I output, more knowledge and ideas converted into 
products and services   
 Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society  
At organisation level:   
 Enhanced cooperation and stronger networks   
 Better transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines   
 Boosting of R&I capacity among participating organisations  
At system level:   
 Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers in 
Europe

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange  
H2020-MSCA-RISE-2017 
MSCA-RISE 2017:  Research and Innovation Staff Exchange 
Objective: The RISE scheme will promote international and inter-sector collaboration through 
research and innovation staff exchanges, and sharing of knowledge and ideas from research to 
market (and vice-versa). 
The scheme fosters a shared culture of research and innovation that welcomes and rewards 
creativity and entrepreneurship and helps to turn creative ideas into innovative products, 
services or processes. 
Scope: RISE involves organisations from the academic and non-academic sectors (in 
particular SMEs), based in Europe (EU Member States and Associated Countries) and outside 
Europe (third countries). 
Support is provided for the development of partnerships in the form of a joint research and 
innovation project. This is aimed at knowledge sharing via international as well as 
intersectoral mobility, based on secondments of research and innovation staff (exchanges) 
with an in-built return mechanism. 
The organisations constituting the partnership contribute directly to the implementation of a 
joint research and innovation project by seconding and/or hosting eligible staff members. 
Secondments shall always take place between legal entities independent from each other15. 
RISE should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations, as well 
as other synergies, and enable networking activities, organisation of workshops and 
conferences to facilitate sharing of knowledge, new skills acquisition and career development 
for research and innovation staff members. 
RISE projects can focus either on one dimension of mobility (intersectoral / international), or 
include a combination of both. 
Exchanges can be for both early-stage and experienced researchers' levels and can also 
include administrative, managerial and technical staff directly involved in the research and 
innovation activities of the proposal. 
Support for the exchanges between institutions within Europe (EU Member States and 
Associated Countries) covers only intersectoral secondments. 
                                                 
 
15     Independence in the meaning of Article 8 of the Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation. 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 39 of 72 
 
Exchanges with institutions from and to third countries can be intersectoral as well as within 
the same sector. 
Secondments between institutions located in third countries or within the same EU Member 
State or Associated Country will not be supported. 
Expected Impact: 
At staff member level:   
 Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved 
employability and career prospects both in and outside academia   
 Increase in higher impact R&I output, more knowledge and ideas converted into 
products and services   
 Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society  
At organisation level:   
 Enhanced cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines   
 Strengthening of international and intersectoral collaborative networks   
 Boosting of R&I capacity among participating organisations  
At system level:   
 Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers in 
Europe   
 Strengthening of Europe's human capital base in R&I   
 Increase in Europe's attractiveness as a leading destination for R&I

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Co-funding of regional, national and international 
programmes 
H2020-MSCA-COFUND-2017 
MSCA-COFUND-2017:  
Co-funding 
of 
regional, 
national 
and 
international 
programmes 
Objective: The COFUND scheme aims to stimulate regional, national or international 
programmes to foster excellence in researchers' training, mobility and career development, 
spreading the best practices of Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
This will be achieved by co-funding new or existing regional, national, and international 
programmes to open up to, and provide for, international, intersectoral and interdisciplinary 
research training, as well as transnational and cross-sectoral mobility of researchers at all 
stages of their career. 
Scope: Each proposal funded under the COFUND scheme shall have a sole beneficiary that 
will be responsible for the availability of the necessary matching funds to execute the 
proposal. 
Applicants submit multi-annual proposals for new or existing doctoral programmes or 
fellowship programmes which are expected to have an impact on enhancing research- and 
innovation related human resources on regional, national or international level. 
Applicants having benefited from COFUND under previous calls (under the Seventh 
Framework Programme or under Horizon 2020) will explain how their proposal adds value in 
relation to previous grant(s). This can also take the form of increased networking with 
organisations in less represented countries or capacity building measures there. 
Researchers supported under this scheme shall comply with the mobility rules of the Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
Limitations regarding the researchers' origin and destination should be avoided. Support 
cannot be awarded to researchers who are already permanently employed by the organisation 
hosting them. 
Proposed programmes are encouraged to cover all research disciplines ("bottom-up"), but can 
also focus on specific disciplines. In this case the range of covered disciplines should allow 
reasonable flexibility for the researchers. 
Programmes that prioritise specific research disciplines based on national or regional 
Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies) can also be 
supported. Synergies with the European Structural & Investment Funds (ESIF) are 
encouraged. 
COFUND takes the form of: 
A) Doctoral programmes 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 43 of 72 
 
Doctoral programmes address the development and broadening of the research competencies 
of early-stage researchers. The training follows the EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral 
Training. Collaboration with a wider set of partner organisations, including from the non-
academic sector, which may provide hosting or secondment opportunities or training in 
research or transferable skills, as well as innovative elements of the proposed programme, will 
be positively taken into account during the evaluation. 
Each researcher must be enrolled in a doctoral programme. Attention is paid to the quality of 
supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. 
B) Fellowship programmes 
Fellowship programmes fund individual research training and career development fellowships 
for experienced researchers. The programmes supported should have regular selection rounds 
following fixed deadlines or regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between the 
researchers applying. The selections should be based on open, widely advertised competition, 
with transparent international peer review and the selection of candidates on merit. Mobility 
types supported by fellowship programmes may be similar to the ones supported under Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships. On top of transnational mobility, applicants are 
encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility into their programmes. Fellowship 
programmes should be based on individual-driven mobility, i.e., researchers should be able to 
freely choose a research topic and the appropriate organisation to host them, fitting their 
individual needs. 
Given that the aim of the co-funded fellowship programmes is the support of individual 
fellows, research teams will not be funded. 
Expected Impact: 
At researcher level:   
 Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved 
employability and career prospects both in and outside academia (leading in the longer-
term to more successful careers)   
 Increase in higher impact R&I output, more knowledge and ideas converted into 
products and services   
 Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society  
At organisation level:   
 Development of high quality human resources   
 Boosting R&I capacity among participating organisations   
 Enhanced cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines   
 Strengthening of international and intersectoral collaborative networks  
At system level:   
 Aligning of practices and policies in the context of the EU Human Resources Strategy 
for Researchers, enhanced implementation of the European Charter and Code and the 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 44 of 72 
 
EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training at regional, national or international 
level   
 Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers in 
Europe   
 Improvement in the working and employment conditions for researchers in Europe at all 
levels of their career, starting from the doctoral stage

Trans-national cooperation among Marie Skłodowska-Curie National 
Contact Points 
H2020-MSCA-NCP-2017 
MSCA-NCP-2017:  MSCA National Contact Points  
Objective: Facilitate trans-national co-operation between National Contact Points (NCPs) for 
the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions (MSCA), with a view to identifying and sharing good 
practices and raising the general standard of support to applicants, taking into account the 
diversity of actors. 
Scope: Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of 
MSCA. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of 
the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint 
workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, training sessions linked to MSCA as 
well as to Responsible Research and Innovation, twinning schemes, etc. Special attention will 
be given to enhancing the competence of MSCA NCPs, including helping less experienced 
NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries. It will also be 
encouraged to build up cooperation with other networks to increase visibility to potential 
beneficiaries, especially in the non-academic sector. 
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to MSCA and should not duplicate actions 
foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under 'Science with 
and for Society'. 
Only NCP organisations from EU Member States, Associated Countries, and third countries 
which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to 
participate in and receive funding for this action. 
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs. 
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States, Associated 
Countries or third countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium are 
nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), 
and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the 
consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the 
Commission. 
The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic. The maximum duration of 
support will be three years from the starting date specified in the grant agreement. 
Expected Impact:    
 An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, therefore helping 
simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and 
raising the average quality of submitted proposals.   
 A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe.

Eligibility conditions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions 
 
Proposal 
A proposal will only be considered eligible if it complies with the eligibility conditions set out 
in this section, depending on the type of MSC action. 
Participating organisations 
1. Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions must fulfil the minimum conditions concerning 
participating organisations: 
 
 For IF: 
The beneficiary must be a legal entity located in an EU Member State or Horizon 2020 
associated country and must employ and supervise the researcher during the action. 
In addition to the above, for IF European Fellowship (EF) Society and Enterprise Panel, 
the beneficiary must be an entity from the non-academic sector. 
 
 For ITN: 
For ITN European Training Networks (ETN) and ITN European Joint Doctorates 
(EJD): the consortium must be composed of at least three beneficiaries located in three 
different EU Member States or Horizon 2020 associated countries. All three legal entities 
must be independent of each other. 
In order to reach the objectives of EJD, at least three beneficiaries must be entitled to 
award doctoral degrees21. A beneficiary from the academic sector, which has transferred 
the right of awarding a doctoral degree to a consortium/grouping of academic/research 
institutions to which it belongs to, is also eligible. Letters of commitment to award the 
joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees must be included in the proposal. 
For ITN European Industrial Doctorates (EID): the consortium must be composed of 
at least two independent beneficiaries located in two different EU Member States or 
Horizon 2020 associated countries. 
Given the nature of EID, at least one beneficiary must be from the academic sector and at 
least one beneficiary must come from the non-academic sector, primarily enterprises. 
Should none of the academic beneficiaries be entitled to award a doctoral degree22, a 
university or a consortium/grouping of academic/research institutions entitled to award a 
doctoral degree must be associated to the project as a partner organisation.  
For all ITN: all beneficiaries are required to host at their premises and supervise recruited 
researchers. 
                                                 
 
21  For EJD, at least two institutions conferring a joint, double or multiple doctoral degree must be established in 
an EU Member State and/or associated country.   
22 Every time the document refers to doctoral degrees, this means that the degrees have to be recognised as such 
by the relevant authorities of the country or countries concerned. 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 56 of 72 
 
The overall EU contribution for ITN actions is limited to a maximum of 540 person-
months. For EID with only two beneficiaries, this limit is set to 180 person-months.  
Not more than 40.0% of the requested EU contribution may be allocated to beneficiaries 
in the same country or to any one international European interest organisation or 
international organisation (except for EID with only two beneficiaries). 
 
 For RISE: the consortium must be created by at least three legal entities, independent of 
each other and established in at least three different countries. At least two of them must 
be beneficiaries located in an EU Member State or Horizon 2020 associated country. If 
all participating organisations are from the same sector (i.e. either only academic or only 
non-academic), there must be at least one partner organisation from a third country. 
Above this minimum, the participation of beneficiaries/partner organisations from any 
country is possible under the conditions provided by the Horizon 2020 Rules for 
Participation Regulation No 1290/2013. 
For RISE actions, only legal entities that are established in EU Member States or Horizon 
2020 associated countries can be beneficiaries; only legal entities that are established in 
third countries can be partner organisations. 
The overall EU contribution for RISE actions is limited to a maximum 540 person-
months. 
 For COFUND: the beneficiary must be a legal entity established in an EU Member State 
or Horizon 2020 associated country that funds or manages doctoral programmes or 
fellowship programmes for researchers. 
 
2. In addition, the following rules apply: 
 
 The eligibility criteria formulated in Commission notice Nr 2013/C 205/05 (OJEU C 205 
of 19.07.2013, pp. 9-11) apply for all actions under this part of the Work Programme, 
including to partner organisations and to third parties that receive financial support under 
the action (in accordance with Article 137 of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012), 
notably COFUND. 
 
 Natural or legal persons, groups or non-State entities which are covered by the Council 
sanctions in force are not eligible to participate in EU programmes. (Please see the 
consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU sanctions, available at:  
http://eeas.europa.eu/cfsp/sanctions/consol-list_en.htm.) 
 
 Given that the EU does not recognise the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol, 
legal persons established in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or the city of Sevastopol 
are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This criterion also applies in cases where 
the action involves financial support given by grant beneficiaries to third parties 
established in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or the city of Sevastopol (in 
accordance with Article 137 of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012). Should the illegal 
annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol end, this 
Work Programme will be revised.

Part 3 - Page 57 of 72 
 
 Note:  
 
1. Once the minimum eligibility conditions are fulfilled and provided that the conditions laid 
down in this Work Programme are met, any other organisation from any country may 
participate – under the conditions set out in Part A of the General Annexes to the Work 
Programme. 
 
2. For the minimum eligibility conditions: if one of the participants is an international 
European interest organisation, the EU's Joint Research Centre (JRC) or an 'entity created 
under Union law' (see Article 9(2) of the Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation Regulation), it 
shall be considered to be established in an EU Member State or Horizon 2020 associated 
country other than the EU Member States / Horizon 2020 associated countries in which the 
other participants are established.  
 
3. The following definitions apply: 
'Beneficiaries' are the legal entities that sign the grant agreement and have the responsibility 
for the proper implementation of the action. They contribute directly to the implementation of 
the research, transfer of knowledge and training activities. Depending on the type of MSC 
action, this involves recruiting, supervising, hosting, training23 or seconding researchers or 
managing and funding programmes.  
'Partner organisations' contribute to the implementation of the action, but do not sign the grant 
agreement. Partner organisations may not employ the researchers under the action24. 
Partner organisations identified in the proposal must include a letter of commitment25 (with 
the proposal) to ensure their real and active participation in the network. (The contribution of 
any partner organisations for which no such evidence of commitment is submitted will not be 
taken into account during evaluation). 
When partner organisations are involved, beneficiaries are encouraged to sign a partnership 
agreement with them (for the internal relationship between participating organisations). 
These partnership agreements must comply with the grant agreement. 
                                                 
 
23 For ITN and IF: If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may call upon entities with a 
capital or legal link to the beneficiaries to implement certain action tasks described in Annex 1 of the grant 
agreement (see Article 8 to the Model Grant Agreement). The involvement of such entities must be clearly 
described in the proposal and will be assessed as part of the evaluation. 
24 For COFUND and the IF Global Fellowships outgoing phase, this restriction does not apply: In COFUND, 
partner organisations implementing the action can employ the researchers. In IF Global Fellowships, the 
outgoing host partner organisation can conclude an additional employment contract with the researcher to ensure 
adequate medical/social insurance in the outgoing country. 
25 Except in IF for partner organisations located in EU Member States or associated countries. 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 58 of 72 
 
'Academic sector' means public or private higher education establishments awarding 
academic degrees, public or private non-profit research institutes whose primary mission is 
to pursue research, and international European interest organisations26. 
'Non-academic sector' means any socio-economic actor not included in the academic sector 
and fulfilling the requirements of the Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation. This includes all 
fields of future workplaces of researchers, from industry to business, government, civil society 
organisations, cultural institutions, etc. 
 
Recruited researchers / seconded staff 
1. ITN, IF and COFUND actions must include the recruitment of researchers (for ITN and IF: 
they must be recruited by the beneficiary; for COFUND: they can be recruited by a partner 
organisation). 
RISE actions must include the secondment of staff members. 
2. Supported researchers and staff members may be of any nationality. They must move from 
one country to another to broaden or deepen their competences. 
For IF Global Fellowships (GF) and the European Fellowships (EF) Reintegration Panel: the 
researchers must be nationals or long-term residents of EU Member States and Horizon 2020 
associated countries. Long-term residence means a period of full-time research activity in the 
EU or Horizon 2020 associated countries of at least 5 consecutive years. 
3. For ITN, IF and COFUND: supported researchers must be either early-stage or 
experienced researchers, depending on the action: 
 For ITN and COFUND Doctoral Programmes (DP): researchers must be early-stage 
researchers (ESR), i.e. at the date of recruitment (ITN) or at the date of recruitment or the 
deadline of the co-funded programme's call (COFUND DP), be in the first four years (full-
time equivalent research experience) of their research careers and have not been awarded a 
doctoral degree. 
 For IF and COFUND Fellowship Programmes (FP): researchers must be experienced 
researchers (ER), i.e. at the date of the call deadline (for IF) or at the date of recruitment 
or the deadline of the co-funded programme's call (for COFUND FP), be in possession of a 
doctoral degree27 or have at least four years of full-time equivalent research experience. 
                                                 
 
26 'International European interest organisation' means an international organisation, the majority of whose 
members are EU Member States or Horizon 2020 associated countries, and whose principal objective is to 
promote scientific and technological cooperation in Europe (see Article 2.1(12) of the Horizon 2020 Rules for 
Participation Regulation No 1290/2013). 
27 A medical doctor degree will not be accepted by itself as equivalent to a doctoral degree. To be considered as 
experienced researchers, medical doctors need to provide the certificates of a doctoral degree or information on 
their research experience. 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 59 of 72 
 
 Note:  
'Full-time equivalent research experience' is measured from the date when the researcher 
obtained the degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctorate (either in the country in which 
the degree was obtained or in the country in which the researcher is recruited or seconded) – 
even if a doctorate was never started or envisaged. 
For RISE: supported staff members must be (early-stage or experienced) researchers or 
administrative, managerial or technical staff supporting the research and innovation activities 
under the action. They must be actively engaged in or linked to research and/or innovation 
activities for at least six months (full-time equivalent) at the sending institution28, before the 
first period of secondment. 
4. For ITN, IF and COFUND: researchers must comply with the mobility rule29. 
Researchers may not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the 
country of their host organisation for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately before 
the reference date: the call deadline (IF), or recruitment (ITN) or either of these two points in 
time (COFUND).  
For 'international European interest organisations' or 'international organisations', the 
researchers may not have spent more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately before the 
call deadline/recruitment, in the same appointing organisation. 
For the IF Society and Enterprise Panel, Career Restart Panel and Reintegration Panel or 
equivalent activities under COFUND, researchers may not have resided or carried out their 
main activity in the country of their host organisation for more than 3 years in the 5 years 
immediately before the reference date. 
Compulsory national service, short stays such as holidays and time spent as part of a 
procedure for obtaining refugee status under the Geneva Convention30 are not taken into 
account. 
For RISE: secondments are not subject to a mobility rule.  
 
5. The minimum/maximum duration of the funded recruitment/secondment is: 
                                                 
 
28 If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries/partner organisations may call upon entities with a 
capital or legal link to the beneficiaries/partner organisations, to implement certain action tasks described in 
Annex 1 of the grant agreement (see Article 8 to the Model Grant Agreement). The involvement of such entities 
must be clearly described in the proposal and will be assessed as part of the evaluation. 
29 Existing programmes applying for COFUND can deviate from this rule if duly justified in the proposal by the 
applicant.

 For ITN:  
 
Recruitment/fellowship duration: 3-36 months 
 
Secondments are possible for up to 30% of the fellowship duration (except for EID and 
EJD – where time spent at other participating organisations, in line with the proposal 
description, is not affected by this limitation). 
For ITN EID, researchers must spend at least 50% of their time in the non-academic 
sector. This inter-sectoral mobility has to be between participating organisations located 
in different countries. 
 
 For IF: 
IF European Fellowships (EF): recruitment/fellowship duration: 12-24 months 
IF Global Fellowships (GF): recruitment/fellowship duration: 24-36 months (12-24 
months for the outgoing phase plus 12 month return phase in Europe) 
 For RISE:  
Secondment duration: 1-12 months  
Secondments may be split into several stays not exceeding 12 months in total and not 
going beyond the project duration. The splits must be justified and considered beneficial 
for the transfer of knowledge activities.  
The exchanged staff members must be guaranteed reintegration into the sending 
institution, thus maximising the impact of the action for knowledge sharing and long-term 
collaboration. 
 For COFUND:  
 
Recruitment/fellowship duration: minimum 3 months 
For programmes where the main part of the research training activity does not take place 
in an EU Member State or an Horizon 2020 associated country, the return phase to a 
Member State/associated country may not be more than 50% of the total duration of the 
research training activity. 
 
 
Duration of the action 
The maximum duration of the action will be the following: 
 For ITN: 48 months from the starting date set out in the grant agreement. 
 For IF: equals the duration of support granted to the researcher. 
 For RISE: 48 months from the starting date set out in the grant agreement. 
 For COFUND: 60 months from the starting date set out in the grant agreement. 
For ITN and COFUND, the maximum duration also includes the time that is needed to recruit 
or select the researchers.

Evaluation rules for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions 
 
Award criteria, scores and weighting 
1. Proposals will be evaluated by experts, on the basis of the award criteria 'excellence', 
'impact' and 'quality and efficiency of the implementation' (see Article 15 of the Horizon 2020 
Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013).  
The aspects to be considered in each case and the weighting depend on the type of Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie action as set out in the tables below. 
2. Evaluation scores will be awarded for each of the criteria, and not their individual 
elements. Each criterion will be scored from 0 to 5. Scores with a resolution of one decimal 
place may be awarded. The total score will be subject to a threshold of 70%. 
3. If necessary, the panel will determine a priority order for proposals which have been 
awarded the same score within a ranked list. When the total scores are equal, priority will be 
based on scores for individual award criteria. For each action the priority order of the criteria 
is detailed in the tables below. 
If necessary, any further prioritisation will be based on other appropriate characteristics, to be 
decided by the panel, related to the contribution of the proposal to the European Research 
Area (ERA) and/or general objectives mentioned in the work programme (e.g. intersectoral 
mobility, international co-operation, favourable employment and working conditions). 
Whether or not such a prioritisation is carried out will depend on the available budget or other 
call conditions.

Evaluation procedure 
1. In ITN, IF and RISE, proposals will normally be evaluated by one of eight 'main 
evaluation panels': Chemistry (CHE), Social Sciences and Humanities (SOC), Economic 
Sciences (ECO), Information Science and Engineering (ENG), Environment and Geosciences 
(ENV), Life Sciences (LIF), Mathematics (MAT), Physics (PHY).  
For ITN European Industrial Doctorates (EID) and European Joint Doctorates (EJD), 
proposals will be ranked in specific multidisciplinary panels.  
For IF, there are – in addition to the main evaluation panels – three separate multidisciplinary 
panels: Society and Enterprise Panel (SE), Career Restart Panel (CAR) and the Reintegration 
Panel (RI).  
In COFUND, the evaluation will be organised in two different panels: Doctoral programmes 
(DP) and Fellowship programmes (FP). 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 66 of 72 
 
Each panel establishes a ranked list.  
The distribution of the indicative budget of the call will be proportional to the number of 
eligible proposals received in each panel, except where a specific budget for a 
multidisciplinary panel has been fixed in the call. If the budget allocated to any panel exceeds 
the requirements of all proposals positively evaluated31 in that panel, the excess budget will be 
reallocated to the other panels based on the distribution as above. Equally, if the allocated 
funding to a panel is insufficient to fund the highest ranked proposal in that panel, the 
necessary budget will be transferred from the other panels based on the distribution as above, 
in order to ensure that the highest ranked proposal can be funded. 
2. Proposals will not be evaluated anonymously. 
3. Proposals may be evaluated remotely. 
4. In ITN and IF, the consensus score for each award criterion may be the average of the 
corresponding scores attributed by the individual expert evaluators. 
5. As part of the evaluation by independent experts, a panel review will recommend one or 
more ranked lists for the proposals under evaluation, following the scoring systems indicated 
in this work programme.  
The full evaluation procedure is described in the relevant guide published on the Participant 
Portal.

EU contribution and applicable unit costs 
The EU contribution under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions is based on unit costs 
expressed in person-months. They have been established in line with the methodology set up 
by Commission Decision No C(2013) 819432. 
1. ITN / IF / COFUND 
The beneficiary (beneficiary or partner organisation in COFUND) must recruit each eligible 
researcher under an employment contract or 'equivalent direct contract' with full social 
security coverage (including sickness, parental, unemployment and invalidity benefits, 
pension rights, benefits in respect of accidents at work and occupational diseases) except 
where national legislation prohibits this possibility.  
When an employment contract cannot be provided, the beneficiary (beneficiary or partner 
organisation in COFUND) must recruit the researcher under a 'fixed-amount fellowship'. In 
this case, the living allowance33 will be halved and the beneficiary must ensure that the 
researcher enjoys minimum social security coverage.  
ITN / IF 
The yearly reference rates for calculating the living allowance of researchers recruited under 
an employment contract/ equivalent direct contract are: 
 for early-stage researchers (ITN): 37 320 EUR/year 
 for experienced researchers (IF): 55 800 EUR/year 
The above amounts include all compulsory deductions under national legislation. Rates for 
individual countries are obtained by applying the country correction coefficients of table 2. 
The beneficiary must pay to the recruited researchers at least the reference allowances (minus 
all compulsory deductions under national legislation in the context of the project). A top-up 
may be paid to the researchers in order to complement this contribution. 
In addition to the living allowance, the beneficiary must pay a mobility allowance and for 
some categories of researchers, a family allowance, as specified in table 1. In this context 
family is defined as persons linked to the researcher by (i) marriage, or (ii) a relationship with 
equivalent status to a marriage recognised by the legislation of the country or region where 
this relationship was formalised; or (iii) dependent children who are actually being maintained 
by the researcher. 
                                                 
 
32 COMMISSION DECISION authorising the use of reimbursement on the basis of unit costs for Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme 
33 Researcher unit cost in case of COFUND 
 HORIZON 2020 – Work Programme 2016-2017 
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions 
Part 3 - Page 68 of 72 
 
The rates from table 1 apply to researchers devoting themselves to their project on a full-time 
basis (pro-rata for parts of years). In cases where researchers, in agreement with the 
beneficiary and with prior approval by the Research Executive Agency (REA), implement 
their project on a part-time basis due to personal or family reasons, the rates will apply 
proportionally without the possibility that the total amounts will exceed those that apply for 
full-time equivalent periods. The same principle will also apply in case of a split of a project 
into several distinct periods. 
COFUND 
The EU contribution is limited to EUR 10 million per beneficiary per call.  
Table 1 specifies the researcher unit cost and the institutional unit cost for the co-funding of 
regional, national and international programmes. The EU contribution must be used 
exclusively as contribution to the management of the programme and to the living allowance 
of the researchers, which is solely for the benefit of the researchers appointed under the 
programme and includes all compulsory deductions under national legislation. Other cost 
items (such as research costs, travel, family and mobility allowances, indirect costs) may be 
funded through other resources including EU programmes other than Horizon 2020.  
Applicants must specify in their proposal the total cost of the proposal and in particular, the 
amounts that will be provided for the benefit of the researcher and for the organisation that is 
hosting the researcher. This information will be needed to evaluate the adequateness of 
employment and working conditions of the researchers. 
The remuneration, i.e. the living allowance (salaries, social security contributions, taxes and 
other costs included in the remuneration), and the mobility allowance for the benefit of the 
researchers must be: 
 for researchers recruited under an employment contract: not lower than EUR 2 597 (for 
early-stage researchers) and EUR 3 675 (for experienced researchers); 
 for researchers recruited under a fixed-amount fellowship: not lower than EUR 1 298.50 
(for early-stage researchers) and EUR 1 837.50 (for experienced researchers).

The top-up allowance specified in table 1 must be solely for the benefit of the seconded staff 
member.

* A country correction coefficient applies to the living allowance. This coefficient is the one applicable to the country of the beneficiary, as listed in 
Table 2. The only exception are IF Global Fellowships with two different country correction coefficients:  
 for the outgoing phase: the coefficient of the country where the researcher is hosted (i.e. the country of the partner organisation) 
 for the return phase: the coefficient of the country where the researcher returns to (i.e. the country of the beneficiary).
