4. SCOPE / THEMATIC AREAS OF THE CALL
The primary purpose of the planned ForestValue joint call is to contribute to transforming the global
economy from a dependence on fossil and non-renewable raw materials to a sustainable “bio-
based economy”.
The call contributes to the overall objectives of ERA-NETs - including the mobility of researchers and
practitioners between the countries and intensify researcher training, thereby increasing the quality of
European research & innovation actions and their implementation in the market.
The overarching aim of the call is to support projects that will address the development and/or proof of
concepts on novel strategies, methods, processes or products designed to support the forestry and
forest-based industries including their respective partners, resellers, consumers and end-users in
remaining competitive and efficient providers of sustainable bio-products and services. Currently
underutilised potential in the forest-based sector shall be used to develop novel ideas and create new
markets.
The co-funded joint transnational call will address the whole forest-based value chain in two areas:
A. Innovative sustainable management of multifunctional forests including:
1.
… harvesting, planning and logistics systems
2.
… scenarios based on the induced future alterations of species mix under predicted effects of
climate change
3.
… defining tree species and cultivars (including breeding approaches) adapted to changing
environmental influences (biotic and abiotic)
4.
… fostering resilience of forest ecosystems and forest production systems (incl. pests, diseases,
invasive species) e.g. through managing biodiversity, from genes to local communities
5.
… methodologies for assessing the economic, social and environmental values of forest products
and services in regional and national scales; deducting trade-offs in management
6.
…non-wood forest products
B. Innovative industrial production and processing technologies, products, concepts and services
focussing at:
1.
... Circular use of forest-based products, side streams and waste within a circular bio-economy.
Energy and resource efficient processes (e.g. by utilising side stream woody biomass for energy)
2.
… Extraction, separation and fractionation of wood components for innovative added value green
chemicals, components and other value-added products and their new functionalities from wood,
wood-based hybrids & composites
3.
… Management concepts for lean timber construction and other building solutions (new &
retrofitted; multi-storey & industrial buildings) including the utilization of soft and hardwood
resources
4.
… Consequential full life cycle environmental, social and economic impacts of wood and wood
construction
5.
… Efficient use of raw materials and other resources taking into account large scale raw material
use alterations (e.g. by additional users (biorefinery))
6.
… Quality assessment of wood resources for different uses; also taking into account raw material
properties induced by future alterations of species mix resulting under the predicted effects of
climate change
7.
… Value-added use of forest-based products for dynamically changing societal needs (e.g. new
materials or systems for timber constructions)
 ForestValue CALL FOR PROPOSALS
5
As these topics covering the whole forest value chain are cross-cutting, applicants are encouraged to
make best use of interdisciplinary systems approaches, and to take a look at improving the impact and
integration of social research and economics in this sector.
As the following issues pertain to all parts of the value chain, they may be addressed in each part where
appropriate:

Digitalization (integration of the above topics with state-of-the-art information and communication
technology across company boundaries)

Implications to and from EU and national policy frameworks for the Forest-based sector

Innovative business concepts (incl. business ecosystems) and value added esp. for rural areas

Organisation, harmonisation and standardisation of data storage, formats and protocols. Creation
of meta-databases

Societal perceptions and dialogue about the forestry and wood production sector, its products
and contributions towards a sustainable society

Future development of global circular bio-economy markets and their implication on the European
forest based sector
Interdisciplinary collaboration and involvement of companies and stakeholders are highly welcome.
Consortia may cover basic and/or applied research and/or industrial research and development, close-to-
market research and innovation actions. Please check the national annexes for specific national funding
requirements.
Funding is available for innovative, industrially relevant research and development projects. This means
that a significant step beyond the state of the art is an absolute pre-requisite.
Please note that some specific topics may be out of scope of a certain national programme!
You should always check with all relevant funding organisations for your consortium before
handing in a proposal.
5. RULES FOR PARTICIPATION
5.1 General eligibility criteria
a.
Pre-proposals and full proposals must be written in English and pre-proposals must be
submitted by 23.01.2018 (13:00 CET) via the ForestValue submission website that will be
provided on the ForestValue website (to be opened soon at www.forestvalue.org) in due time.
b.
Pre-proposals, which do not include all the compulsory information or do not meet the formal
requirements listed or mentioned in this call announcement, will not be considered for funding.
c.
If national/regional forms are required, these must be submitted directly to the national/regional
agency (see Annex IV).
d.
Consortia must include at least three independent legal entities applying for funding from three
different countries with funding agencies participating in the call (see Annex IV). The number of
partners per consortium is not limited, but the manageability of the consortium must be
demonstrated (efficient consortia of typically 5-8 partners for medium-sized projects with total
budget in a range of 1-2 Mio € are expected).
e.
Proposals must demonstrate added value from the international cooperation, in comparison to
national projects, which should be evident in the layout and execution of the work packages. The
work plan must show real cooperation and project outputs are expected to provide benefits to all
partner countries.
 ForestValue CALL FOR PROPOSALS
6
f.
Consortia also need to be balanced between countries both in terms of number of partners and
distribution of budget; such that all project partners contribute to and benefit from an equitable
and balanced cooperation. To address this, the public funding requested by partners of a
collaborative project of one country must not exceed 50% of the total public funding requested.
g.
Proposals should strive to foster gender balance especially among the personnel named in the
proposal primarily responsible for carrying out the research and/or innovation activities. In
addition, gender equality should be promoted at all levels of personnel involved in projects as well
as in terms of the expected benefit from the knowledge created.
5.2 Eligible funding recipients / consortia
a.
The initiative is intended to facilitate transnational collaboration between industry, small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), stakeholder associations, research organisations, leading-
edge scientists from a wider range of disciplines covering forest management, wood material,
construction, natural, biological, social, economic and other relevant sciences who will bring their
broad expertise to support the transformation of the European forest-based sector and to secure
its competitiveness.
b.
Wherever possible and meaningful, the participation of commercial and industrial partners
– especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – is strongly recommended to
ensure the relevance of the research to technological development and to the needs of
society. The participation of young scientists in the research teams is encouraged. Please
note, however, some national programmes are not open to commercial and industrial
partners (see Annex IV).
If industry participation is not feasible due to the scope/outlay of the envisaged work, the reasons
for this decision should be explained in the proposal. Note that detailed exploitation and
dissemination plans are an important feature of every proposal.
c.
Innovative
forms
of
cooperation
are
encouraged,
i.e.
interdisciplinary
research
and
implementation across disciplinary boundaries of forest-related sciences which deliver meaningful
cooperation between biophysical/natural and social scientists. Additionally, involvement of a
variety of stakeholders from different geographic areas will better enable exchange of experience
and expertise from varied academic backgrounds.
d.
Partners from countries which are not participating in the call are also encouraged to join a
consortium (as additional partners; the minimum number of three partners from countries
participating in this call remains). These so-called “third country” partners must finance their
activities from other sources and need to state in advance the source of funding for their part in
the project. In the full proposal phase, a letter of commitment must be included in the proposal
confirming the source of funding. Projects must ensure that the exploitation of results focuses on
the ForestValue partner countries and that all exploitation in third countries clearly indicates the
Union funding that contributed to this project. These so-called “third country” partners are entitled
to follow any applicable H2020 participation rules.
e.
The coordinator of any applying consortium must be from an organisation that is eligible for
funding from one of the agencies participating in the call, i.e. an organisation that plans to
participate at their own expense, without public funding provided via the ForestValue joint call,
cannot act as coordinator. The project coordinator will represent the consortium externally and
towards the Call Office and will be responsible for its internal scientific management (such as
controlling, reporting, intellectual property rights (IPR) issues and contact with the Call Office).
Each project partner will be represented by one (and only one) principal investigator. Within a
joint proposal, each project partner’s principal investigator will be the contact person for the
relevant national/regional funding organisation.
f.
National funding regulations are applied within this joint call. In addition to the general rules and
procedures laid down in this document, there may be specific national rules to be followed by the
 ForestValue CALL FOR PROPOSALS
7
applicants. It is strongly recommended that these are checked with the contact person at
the respective funding agency before submitting a proposal.
Please note that individual national funding organisations may be limited in the kind of
project and the kind of organisation they could support. These restrictions, as well as other
important national regulations, can be found in Annex IV “Specific National Rules” at the
end of this document.
Projects with ineligible partners at pre-proposal stage risk ineligibility of the whole project!
6. APPLICATION & ASSESSMENT
In this call a competitive two-stage submission process is used. The planned work is first presented as a
short pre-proposal which is checked for eligibility and suitability for national funding. After the scientific
evaluation by independent experts, consortia will be informed if they are invited to submit a full proposal
based on this initial concept.
6.1 Step 1: Pre-proposals
•
Pre-proposal applications must be submitted via the electronic submission system which will be
available on the ForestValue website. It is the responsibility of each applicant to ensure their
proposals are submitted on time, as the electronic submission system will close at 13:00 CET
and late submissions (after 13:00 CET) will not be taken into account in order to ensure the
fairness towards other applicants. Pre-proposals exceeding the maximum number of pages (7
plus partner details and CVs; specified in the submission system) will not be taken into account.
After the closing date for submission of the pre-proposal the information given cannot
substantially deviate in the full proposal phase in content of the proposed project, approach,
composition of the consortium and budget, unless this has been explicitly requested. For the
partners budget only minor changes might be allowed with specific justification (the final
requested amount of each partner may not increase!). All changes need to be consulted with all
respective funding agencies.
Some national funding bodies may also require specific national documents (application forms or
similar) from “their” applicants at this stage. Such national documents are NOT submitted
centrally, but directly to the relevant ministry or agency. Please consult the relevant Specific
National Rules at the end of this document for further details.
DEADLINE for submission of pre-proposals: 23rd January 2018 13:00 CET
All applications are subject to confidential evaluation.
•
The pre-proposals will first be checked for eligibility by the Call Office with regard to mandatory
eligibility criteria defined in the call text (“5. Rules for participation”). Afterwards the funding
organisations will check the eligibility of the pre-proposals and their suitability for national funding
in line with the restrictions laid down in the Specific National Rules in Annex IV.
•
Eligible pre-proposals will be scientifically evaluated by at least three international experts with
regard to the criteria laid down in Annex I to this call text.
•
Expert panel members must sign a “declaration on conflict of interest” to ensure confidentiality
and avoid any conflict of interest during the evaluation and selection procedures of the joint call.
The online evaluation tool will include a feature which will prevent access to the proposal in case
a conflict of interest is declared by the expert.
•
The Call Steering Committee will, based on the recommendations of the independent experts,
select those pre-proposals that may enter the full proposal phase. After the evaluation of the pre-
proposals all research consortia will be informed of the outcome of the evaluation and will receive
 ForestValue CALL FOR PROPOSALS
8
a short evaluation assessment statement. Only consortia whose pre-proposals pass the first
evaluation stage will be invited to submit a full proposal.
6.2 Step 2: Full proposals
DEADLINE for submission of full proposals: 14th August 2018 13:00 CEST
Full proposal applications must be submitted ON TIME via the
electronic submission system on the ForestValue website.
•
Full proposal applications must incorporate the feedback provided during the pre-proposal stage
assessment. A non-confidential abstract of the description of work is required (for later publication
in case of success only).
•
Any amendments from pre-proposal to full proposal have to be declared as such in the full
proposal.
•
All full proposals are subject to confidential evaluation.
•
Submitted full proposals will be briefly checked if eligibility is still guaranteed and after this
evaluated centrally by a joint and independent international peer review based on the evaluation
criteria stated in Annex I to this call text. Each proposal will be evaluated by at least three
independent experts.
•
At the end of the evaluation process, the evaluator panel will determine on one final ranking list of
proposals. Based on the ranking list and the available funding, the ForestValue partners will
decide in accordance with the H2020 ERA-NET Cofund rules and the national and/or regional
budget availability on the projects to be funded.
•
The Call Office will inform the coordinators of all research consortia of the evaluation outcome by
sending an evaluation summary. Those consortia recommended for funding will additionally be
informed of the next steps to be taken in order to start national contract negotiations. The
coordinators of the research consortia are responsible for communicating the decisions to the
consortium partners.
7. FUNDING & MONITORING
•
Research will be funded from national sources, i.e. research grants will be administered
through the participating national funding organisations. In addition to the general rules and
procedures laid out in the call text, applicants must comply with the terms and conditions of their
responsible funding agencies and programmes (see Annex IV: Specific National Rules).
•
Projects funded through this initiative are expected to have a duration between 24 and 36
months. Applicants can choose the duration according to the scope of their project. The start and
end date should be the same for all partners in a consortium.
ATTENTION: please note that, due to legal restrictions, projects under this call cannot be
granted any extensions!
•
If a proposal is selected for funding, the partners are required to sign a consortium agreement
which specifies Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and other issues regarding responsibilities
within the project and exploitation of results. The consortium agreement must be signed
before the first payments can be made.
•
A list of the funded projects will be published at the end of the co-funded call. Therefore,
applicants should be aware that the following information may be published by ForestValue and
by the European Commission: project title, project acronym, project duration, total funding, name
of the project coordinator (including contact information as email and telephone number), country
 ForestValue CALL FOR PROPOSALS
9
and organisation name of each partner, the publishable summary of the project from the
application. Information on each funded project, including data on each participant and an
overview on the results will be sent to the European Commission after the end of the project
period.
•
In addition to the standard requirements of your funding agency, brief annual reports and a final
report are needed to meet the requirements of the ForestValue Research Programme. In
addition, the consortia of funded projects will be asked to provide data on the impact of the
research project via one brief annual questionnaire. The annual reports will be kept confidential,
except that they will all include a non-confidential summary which will be made available to the
public (see below). The final reports should not include any confidential information since they will
be published on the ForestValue website.
•
In addition, brief project updates suitable for immediate publication have to be provided to the
ForestValue consortium annually and a minimum of 3 stakeholder-oriented articles during the
entire project duration. Detailed information on the reporting and monitoring procedures as well
as templates will be provided to the coordinators of the funded projects right after the projects
have started. The coordinator of each project will be responsible for compiling and submitting
reports and other deliverables to the ForestValue Research Programme on behalf of the project
consortium.
•
Representatives from funded consortia are requested to participate and represent their projects in
three follow-up seminars throughout the duration of the programme: kick-off, mid-term and final
seminar. The seminars will aim to bring together researchers and stakeholders from industry,
academia and policy-making organisations in the forest-based Bioeconomy sector in order to
discuss the projects’ objectives/results as well as to facilitate information exchange and
networking. For each seminar, the projects are asked to produce policy briefs targeting
regional/national/European policy/decision makers.
•
The funded projects will also be encouraged to arrange focused joint workshops with thematically
related projects.
•
Researchers are encouraged to actively exploit the results of the research project and make them
available for use, whether for commercial gain or not, in order for public benefit to be obtained
from the knowledge created.
•
In case of ANY significant changes in the work program or the consortium composition, besides
contacting the respective funding agencies, the coordinator must inform the Call Office, who will,
together with the relevant funding organisations decide upon the proper action to be taken.

UNITED KINGDOM (Forestry Commission GB)
BACKGROUND
The UK forestry and timber sector has been growing strongly over the last 20 years as forests established in
the second half of the 20th century mature and produce increasing volumes of timber for production. From an
annual rate of production of around 750,000 m3 in the 1970’s, current harvest now exceeds 11 million m3, and
is projected to continue rising over the next decade. This brings significant opportunities for downstream wood
fibre using sectors. However, as the peak of production approaches with a fall for the following decades, we
need to be smarter and more innovative in the ways in which we can add value from this valuable raw
material.
The Forestry Commission and Scottish Enterprise have been engaged with the WoodWisdom-Net project
since its inception in 2004, and during this time, 62 projects with a combined value of €85 million have been
supported across Europe. The focus of this initiative has consistently been on technological and innovative
approaches to improving the way the sector works to add more value and increase the profitability of
companies.
As a publically funded project, the results of previous WoodWisdom calls are available to all, and there are
many opportunities from the previous work for UK companies to take advantage of. To date 10 UK research
establishments and 6 UK companies have been successful in bidding for funding under the project. The
funders are keen to see this number increase with this new call, and the criteria set out below will help to
ensure that proposals have the best chance of success.
PURPOSE
The overarching aim of the ForestValue project is to promote increased innovation and competitiveness of the
forest-based sector in Europe and support its transformation from a resource-intensive to a knowledge-
intensive, productive, resource-efficient and resilient sector. Sustainability and modernisation of forestry
systems and downstream value chains including innovative business concepts and production technologies
will be needed to develop the forestry sector and the European bioeconomy, of which forestry accounts for a
large share. Basic and applied research, close-to-market research and innovation actions are all envisaged.
In the UK, the funding partners wish the ForestValue initiative to facilitate collaboration amongst specialists in
timber, processing, and/or forest research and leading-edge scientists from the wider engineering,
biotechnology, economic, social and other relevant research communities with broader expertise that could be
brought to bear on the challenge and contribute to the strengthening of capability in this area.
Funding organisation: Forestry Commission GB (FC)
UK funding for this joint call ForestValue is provided by Forestry Commission (FC), Forestry
Commission (Scotland), Construction Scotland Innovation Centre (CSIC), Industrial Biotechnology
Innovation Centre (IBioIC) and Scottish Enterprise (SE), and will be administered by Forestry
Commission GB (FC). The above funding organisations will jointly fund UK participants in
prioritised consortia.
Name and link to funding programme:
Timber Development Programme
Separate national application required: NO, except construction based project proposals which may
require an additional application process. Contact andy.leitch@forestry.gsi.gov
Type of research funded: Public research organisations, research institutes, UK Higher Education
Institutions and industry may apply. Commercial companies (SMEs) are encouraged to participate,
and this will be reflected in the UK project scoring evaluation.
UK project partners are advised that we will expect to fund 2-4 commercially focussed projects over
the life of the call, from the total UK contribution of at least £0.3m. Applicants should state UK costs in
Pounds Sterling and Euros in the transnational application form.
 ForestValue CALL FOR PROPOSALS
35
Funding will be available for researchers from universities and public or private research institutions,
where they can receive up to 100% of eligible costs which include personnel, equipment,
consumables, travel and external assistance. Overhead costs at a rate of 20% of eligible costs will
also be covered. Industry partners are strongly encouraged to participate and up to 80% eligible costs
will be covered.
It is anticipated that projects will include one or more UK businesses and be related directly to the
development of a wood derived solid/non-solid product or process.
As the topics included cover the whole forest value chain and are cross-cutting, the call will also aim to
encourage and make best use of interdisciplinary systems approaches, and improve the impact and
integration of social research and economics in this sector. Proposals should indicate how this might
be addressed.
Other specifications: There is no need to supply additional national application forms in the first or second
stages of the application process unless specifically requested by FC; the transnational application
form to the central call office is sufficient.
After the joint evaluations and preliminary funding decisions, UK project partners to successful
applications will be invited to submit a national application/documentation to FC. Industrial participation
is strongly encouraged and some industrial collaboration is recommended.

project work is clearly and detailed described. Please note that a few points had to be additionally
specified. The usual Wood Action Pan funding rules will apply. The application forms and the
additional specifications will be provided on the webpage
www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/wald/fachinformationen/strategien-und-massnahmen-des-

Institute of Technology, University of Applied Sciences) should be involved in a WAP funded project.
Projects involving several participants are particularly encouraged.
•
As a general rule, the applicants cover at least 50% of the project costs, a further incentive to ensure
the efficient transfer of research results to the market (“reality check”). The industry partner also
makes a cash contribution to its academic partner. There is no federal funding allowed to companies.
•
The criteria for proposal assessment are: Impact on sustainable development, increased demand and
provision of timber out of the forest, uniqueness of the innovation to be developed, close to the market
of the desired project results and the impact on the value chain forest and wood, where the value is
added, potential to increase the image and familiarity of wood from the forest among the population,
institutional builders, architects and planners, potential for increasingly coordinated long-term
communication, potential to increase cooperation within the value chain forest and wood and within
the public administration, clear work programme and a transparent budget.
•
The project must have quantified, measurable goals and a coherent and structured schedule with
verifiable progress milestones. At the end of the project, a plan must be presented showing how the
results will be implemented.
