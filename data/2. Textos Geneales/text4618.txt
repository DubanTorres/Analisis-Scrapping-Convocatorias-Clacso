Introduction 
The Innovative Medicines Initiative is a jointly funded partnership between the European Union, represented by the 
European Commission, and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). 
The Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI2 JU) has been created1 following the principles below: 
Research related to the future of medicine should be undertaken in areas where societal, public health and 
biomedical industry competitiveness goals are aligned and require the pooling of resources and greater 
collaboration between the public and private sectors, with the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs). 
The scope of the initiative should be expanded to all areas of life science research and innovation. 
The areas should be of public health interest, as identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) report on 
priority medicines for Europe and the World2. 
The IMI2 JU objectives are usually implemented through Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs), and 
Coordination and Support Actions (CSAs) where public and private partners collaborate, joining their expertise, 
knowledge and resources.  
The initiative should therefore seek to involve a broader range of partners, including mid-sized companies3, from 
different sectors e.g. biomedical imaging, medical information technology, diagnostic and/or animal health 
industries. Involving the wider community in this way should help to advance the development of new approaches 
and technologies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases with high impact on public health. 
The IMI2 Strategic Research Agenda (SRA)4 is the main reference for the implementation of research priorities for 
IMI2 JU. The scientific priorities for 2020 for IMI2 JU have been prepared based on the SRA. 
Applicant consortia are invited to submit a proposal which should address at least one of the objectives of the topic. 
The size and composition of each consortium should be adapted so as to respond to the scientific goals and the 
expected key deliverables. 
Applicant consortia, during all stages of the evaluation process, must consider the nature and dimension of the IMI2 
JU programme as a public-private collaboration. 
While preparing their proposals, applicant consortia should ensure that the needs of patients are adequately 
addressed and, where appropriate, patient involvement is encouraged. Applicants should ensure that gender 
dimensions are also considered. Synergies and complementarities with other national and international projects 
and initiatives should be explored in order to avoid duplication of efforts and to create collaboration at a global level 
to maximise European added value in health research. Where appropriate, the involvement of regulators is also 
strongly encouraged.

Specific challenges to be addressed by public-private collaborative research 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that typically result in 
respiratory and enteric infections. CoV are zoonotic in origin, but they can evolve into a strain that can infect human 
beings leading to fatal illness. Typically, CoV infections were considered relatively benign to humans before the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002/2003 in China, and the Middle East respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 in the Middle Eastern countries. 
On 31 December 2019, the local authorities of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, reported a cluster of pneumonia 
cases of unknown origin. On 9 January 2020, the China Centre for Disease Control reported a novel coronavirus - 
now referred as SARS-CoV-2 to be the causative agent. 
As of 24 February 2020, 79 360 cases of novel coronavirus infection COVID-19 (in accordance with the applied 
case definitions in the affected countries) have been reported, including 2 618 deaths. The disease has already 
spread to 31 countries outside China, with new cases continuing to emerge daily [1]. The COVID-19 outbreak has 
been declared by WHO as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern according to the International 
Health Regulation [2]. 
Bearing in mind that the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 resulted in over 8 000 cases reported (and a 10% fatality 
ratio), it is crucial to rapidly gain a better understanding of the newly-identified virus and the virus family that it 
represents, especially in relation to potential clinical and public health measures that can be put to immediate use 
to improve patients’ health and/or contain the spread of COVID-19. 
Considering the public health and humanitarian implications, there is a need for all stakeholders across the public 
and private sectors to collaborate in global efforts to care for those affected, contain the outbreak, and develop the 
much-needed resources to prepare for the future. A collaboration of private companies, academia, international 
organisations, public bodies etc. has the potential to accelerate the development of therapeutics and diagnostics to 
tackle the current and future outbreaks. The actions resulting from this Call will contribute to the pan-European 
efforts responding to this Public Health Emergency and address one of the eight immediate research actions 
agreed at the WHO global research and innovation forum held on 11-12 February 2020 [3].  
Scope 
Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to advance our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 specifically and the 
wider coronavirus family in general with the aim of contributing to an efficient patient management and/or public 
health preparedness and response to current and future outbreaks of coronavirus infection.  
Considering that this is a newly-identified virus, the scope of this topic remains broad and must address at least 
one of the following objectives: 
  
 
Call Text – IMI2 21st Call for proposals  
Page | 6  
 
Development of antivirals as well as other types of therapeutics to address a rapid response to the 
current COVID-19 outbreak 
Relevant “clinical ready”-assets include approved therapies or compounds in development, which could be 
repurposed for use in treating patients with the coronavirus. For example, this could include (but is not limited 
to), angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, protease inhibitors or immunotherapies (for example 
antibodies/antibody-like molecules) that could be relevant in the context of CoV. If repurposing is proposed, this 
should be supported by a preliminary rationale of the compound’s potential efficacy against COVID-19. Where 
relevant, evidence of regulatory and ethics approvals for the investigational products included in the study(ies) 
must be presented. 
 
Development of therapeutics to address the current and/or future coronavirus outbreaks Identification of 
new potential assets and approaches that could be utilised including preventive strategies and combination 
approaches, and that could also address potential resistance. This may also include the optimisation of 
promising treatments used in rapid response (e.g. reformulation). 
 
Development of diagnostics, ensuring rapid evaluation of candidates based on existing technologies.  
Diagnostic tests will be essential for clinical trials of new or repurposed drugs, to help stratify patients and 
assess treatment efficiency (surrogate endpoint such as viral clearance).  
 
 
Development of fast and reliable tools that go beyond the state of the art for detection of COVID-19 
carriers and symptomatic individuals suspected of COVID-19 infection 
These are essential and of utmost importance to manage the outbreak, isolate patients at risk and treat people 
accordingly. It is crucial to differentiate and identify respiratory pathogens with similar clinical symptoms (e.g. 
flu, respiratory syncytial virus, other viruses or bacteria) and/or detect emerging pathogens such as SARS-
CoV-2. This can be achieved through point-of-care (POC) testing or centralised testing. 
Preventive vaccines are specifically excluded from the scope of the Call. 
For increased impact, proposals should build on promising avenues from previous or ongoing research, taking into 
account the recommendations from the WHO and ensuring complementarity and ideally synergy with the work 
carried out under the auspices of Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Wellcome, Biomedical 
Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Global 
Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and H2020 Call SC1-PHE-
CORONAVIRUS-2020.  
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has activated its plan for emerging health threats, which includes the 
possibility for fast-tracked Scientific Advice [4]. Proposals covering investigation of a therapeutic should engage 
with the EMA to ensure adequacy from a regulatory point of view. 
Collaboration agreement(s) 
To ensure the interactions between actions funded under this Call, the selected consortia are expected to 
cooperate with each other and share their learnings for the purpose of achieving the objectives of their respective 
actions, in order to maximise the impact. Therefore, all grants awarded under this Call will be complementary 
grants. The respective options under Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the IMI2 JU Model Grant 
Agreement10 will apply. Accordingly, the relevant consortia will conclude collaboration agreement(s) to ensure the 
exchange of relevant information, exploration of synergies, and collaboration where appropriate.

Call Text – IMI2 21st Call for proposals  
Page | 7  
Expected key deliverables 
Each proposal must include at least one of the following key deliverables: 
 
antivirals as well as other types of therapeutics to be used in the current outbreak, including preventive and 
symptomatic treatments; 
 
novel therapeutics including combination treatments to ensure appropriate treatment for current and/or future 
outbreaks and/or to prevent resistance; 
 
diagnostics. 
In the context of achieving the above deliverables, i.e. development of therapeutics and diagnostics, it is 
recognised that studies related to the understanding of the mechanism of action will generate new knowledge on 
the virology, immunology and pathogenesis of the coronavirus, and that new analytical technologies and reagents 
may be developed. 
When relevant, deliverables should include: 
 
Hit identification of suitable assets (e.g. existing libraries, approved drugs and assets that have passed phase 1 
for repurposing; protease and (non)-nucleoside inhibitors) against SARS-CoV-2 and/or pan-coronavirus; 
implementation of high-throughput screening assays in collaboration with Europe-based centres of excellence. 
 
Lead optimisation: initiating target-based discovery programmes based for instance on literature for the 
identification of promising approaches. Proof of Concept: pre-clinical animal studies and clinical studies 
including at least first in human (FIH) and phase 2A and/or 2B studies for both repurposed and new molecular 
entities.  
For the clinical studies applicants should consider the Therapeutic Trial Synopsis in the WHO’s Global 
Research and Innovation Blueprint on the novel Coronavirus COVID-19 [3].  
 
Diagnostics and associated enablers (e.g. production of antibodies and viral proteins); characterisation of nCoV 
strains and evolution; sustainability plans for data repositories, sample repositories etc.; documentation 
supporting regulatory submission. 
Expected impact 
Proposals must be timely, with rapid activation, to enable early and valuable outcomes to be established. 
On the basis of the proposed activities, applicants should describe how the outputs of the project will contribute to 
the following impacts and include wherever possible targets and metrics to measure them: 
 
fast-track development and availability of therapeutics and/or diagnostics to be used in the clinical 
management of patients infected by COVID-19 and/or future outbreaks of coronaviruses, and to ensure that a 
variety of drugs are available for patients, including tackling resistance, and combination therapy; 
 
contribution to public health preparedness and response in the context of the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 
and/or future outbreaks of pan-coronaviruses; 
 
significant impact on global health, both at the individual and the public health level by leading to results that 
have a direct impact on people at risk of exposure to coronavirus or on patients suffering from coronavirus 
disease. 
To ensure maximum impact for patients, applicants should demonstrate their operational capacity as well as their 
readiness and access to asset(s) to progress through clinical development and reach patients as rapidly as 
possible. 
Although actions to be funded should be centred around SARS-CoV-2 and CoV, applicants should explain how the 
knowledge and new concepts arising from the action can be applied in more general terms to the preparedness 
strategy that could be applied to new outbreaks as a rapid response. 
  
 
Call Text – IMI2 21st Call for proposals  
Page | 8  
In addition, considering the unknown evolution of this COVID-19 outbreak, applicants should develop strategies on 
how to develop their proposals and continuity plans, allocate their funds and implement sustainability measures in 
the different scenarios that could occur: 1) rapid regression of the epidemic with no patients left for clinical trials, 2) 
pandemic, 3) seasonal reoccurrence as typically seen with influenza.  
Applicants must maximise the IMI2 JU public-private partnership value by harnessing support from different 
stakeholders, including the mobilisation of resources through the inclusion of contributing partners11, providing 
contributions (in kind and/or financial), to reflect the public-private character of IMI2 JU actions. 
To maximise the potential for public health impact, applicants should outline in their proposals a strategy for 
engagement with patients, healthcare professional associations, healthcare providers, and public health bodies 
where relevant 
Beneficiaries in grants awarded under this topic must make available their research data, at the latest within 30 
days after it has been generated, through open access or, if agreed by the IMI2 JU or the European Commission, 
by giving access rights to those third parties that need the research data to address the public health emergency. 
Therefore, the relevant option (1c) of Article 29.3 of the Grant Agreement shall apply. 
Potential synergies with existing consortia 
Synergies and complementarities are expected with relevant national, European and non-European initiatives 
(including suitable biological and medical sciences research infrastructures12) in order to incorporate past 
achievements, available data and lessons learnt where possible, thus avoiding unnecessary overlap, and 
duplication of efforts and funding. In particular, applicants are expected to collaborate with any relevant project or 
initiative targeting the current COVID-19 outbreak supported by, including but not restricting to, the European 
Commission (H2020 call SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020), CEPI, Wellcome, BARDA, The Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation, GloPID-R, and others. 
Applicants should also consider building on achievements of relevant IMI projects such as the COMBACTE 
projects, ZAPI, and the European Lead Factory (ELF/ESCULAB). 
Where relevant applicants might consider the advantages of the use of the European supercomputing centres 
(PRACE network) to accelerate the process of diagnosis and therapeutics research, using the exiting high-end 
computing, data and simulation resources. 
Indicative duration of the action 
Proposals should include a proposed duration for the action in relation to the activities and expected impact. 
Successful applicants may request a starting date prior the entry into force of the GA, but no earlier than the date of 
grant proposal submission. 
 
                                                      
11 Contributing partners: EFPIA companies or organisations associated to EFPIA, and Associated Partners to IMI2 JU contributing resources to 
the action may report it as their in-kind or financial contribution to the IMI2 JU. If the contributing entity is not yet an affiliate or a constituent 
entity of an IMI2 Member other than the Union (i.e. EFPIA), or an Associated Partner at the time of the proposal submission, and the proposal is 
selected for funding, such a legal entity is invited to become an affiliate or a constituent entity of an IMI2 Member, other than the Union, or an 
Associated Partner in accordance with the IMI2 JU Statutes prior to the signature of the relevant Grant Agreement.

Indicative budget 
Applicant consortia will be competing for the maximum total financial contribution from IMI2 JU up to  
EUR 45 000 000. 
Within this budgetary envelope, each proposal must include a sound justification of the requested IMI2 JU financial 
contribution. This should take into account the proposed in-kind contributions from contributing partners that will 
complement the IMI2 JU financial contribution, i.e. EFPIA constituents or affiliated entities and/or, when relevant, 
IMI2 JU Associated Partners. 
All proposals submitted under this Call and evaluated above the threshold will be ranked in one single list. 
Proposals will be invited in order of ranking to prepare a Grant Agreement within the limits of the available overall 
budget. 
Applicant consortium 
Applicant consortia are expected to address at least one of the objectives of the topic and demonstrate the 
necessary expertise and access to facilities to meet the relevant key deliverables and ensure the expected impact. 
The size and composition of each consortium should be adapted so as to respond to the objectives and the key 
deliverables of the Call while ensuring its manageability. 
In accordance with the Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation, in order to be eligible, a proposal must be made by a 
consortium of at least three independent legal entities, each established in a different Member State or associated 
country. 
While preparing their proposals, applicant consortia should ensure that needs of patients are adequately addressed 
and, where appropriate, patient involvement is encouraged. 
Single stage proposal 
While preparing their proposal, applicants are requested to pay due attention to all the following points. 
Data management 
In their proposal, applicants should give due visibility to data management including use of the data standards. A 
full 'data management plan' (DMP) as a distinct deliverable must be delivered within the first 6 months of the action. 
The DMP needs to be kept up to date with the needs of the action and as such be updated as necessary during its 
lifetime.13 
Applicants should be aware that data must be deposited in a relevant established international data platform, such 
as the one by WHO and/or European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). 
Dissemination, exploitation and communication 
In their proposal, applicants must provide a draft plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results. A full plan as 
a distinct deliverable must be delivered within the first 6 months of the project.14 The proposed communication 
                                                      
13 Guidance on data management is available at https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-

measures for promoting the action and its findings during the period of the grant should also be described and 
could include a possible public event to showcase the results of the action. 
Applicants should be aware that beneficiaries in grants awarded in this Call for proposals are expected to apply the 
principles established in the Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergency. 
Sustainability 
In their proposal, applicants must describe a sustainability plan beyond the end of the Grant Agreement 
This plan may be updated during the action lifetime and could include: 
 
identification of results that may need sustainability solutions; 
 
identification of potential end-users for these results; 
 
a proposed sustainability roadmap. 
The proposed plan should also ensure that the new concepts for rapid response developed in the projects can be 
applied to new outbreak situations. 
Sufficient resources should be set aside for activities related to the sustainability of the project results. This may 
involve engaging with suitable biological and medical sciences research infrastructures (RIs).15 
Patient and healthcare provider engagement 
Applicants are encouraged to include a strategy to engage with patients, learned societies and healthcare 
providers as relevant to ensure the project results impact on healthcare practices. 
Regulatory strategy 
Applicants are expected to have a strategy for the translation of the relevant outputs into regulatory practice to 
promote the uptake of the results, e.g. qualification advice, qualification opinion when relevant. A plan for 
interactions with regulatory agencies/health technology assessment bodies /payers, with relevant milestones and 
sufficient resources, should therefore be proposed.

Emergency. Therefore, the relevant option of Article 29.3 (option 1c) of the IMI2 JU Model Grant Agreement20 will 
apply. It is expected that quality-controlled data are shared in accordance with the FAIR principles. The use of 
harmonised protocols in collaboration with other actors is recommended for this purpose. 
SUBMISSION TOOL 
Proposals in response to a topic of the IMI2 JU Call for proposals must be submitted online, before the call 
deadline, by the coordinator via the Submission Service section of the relevant topic page available under Funding 
& tender opportunities - Single Electronic Data Interchange Area (SEDIA). 
No other means of submission will be accepted. 
OTHERS 
For proposals including clinical trials/studies/investigations, a specific template to help applicants to provide 
essential information on clinical studies in a standardised format is available under:  
https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/templ/h2020_tmpl-clinical-studies_2018-
2020_en.pdf.  
In a single stage evaluation procedure involving clinical studies, the use of this template is mandatory in order to 
provide experts with the necessary information to evaluate the proposals. The template may be submitted as a 
separate document. 
Ethical issues should be duly addressed in each submitted proposal to ensure that the proposed activities comply 
with ethical principles and relevant national, Union and international legislation. Any proposal that contravenes 
ethical principles or which does not fulfil the conditions set out in the H2020 Rules for Participation, or in the IMI2 
JU Call for proposals shall not be selected. 21 
In order to ensure excellence in data and knowledge management consortia will be requested to disseminate 
scientific publications on the basis of open access22 (see ‘Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and 
Research Data in Horizon 2020’). 
To ensure actions are implemented properly, at the time of the signature of the grant agreement, each selected 
consortia must have agreed upon a consortium agreement, i.e. the internal arrangements regarding their operation 
and co-ordination. 
Single-stage proposals must contain a draft plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results. 
Applicants intending to submit a proposal in response to the IMI2 JU Calls should also read the topic text, the IMI2 
JU Manual for submission, evaluation and grant award, and other relevant documents23 (e.g. IMI2 JU model Grant 
Agreement).

in our case. Could you please advise? ........................................................................................................ 19 
39. I am working on a proposal for IMI-2 call 21, but in order to make my project more complete I would like to 
perform some regulatory preclinical test. Could you please be so kind to let me know if this contribution 
could be performed by sub-contractors, and if yes what is the maximum admissible cost for a 
subcontractor? .............................................................................................................................................. 20 
40. I have read that the minimum requirement is three partners from 3 different European countries. How are 
the requirements in regards to numbers of partners from the same country, is there a limit? .................... 20 
41. Data sharing versus intellectual property (IP) rights protection Within publicized documentation it is stated 
that beneficiaries in grants awarded under this topic must make available their research data, at the latest 
within 30 days after it has been generated. What kind of data the beneficiary is obligate to publicize and is 
it up to beneficiary decision which data cannot be shared due to IP rights protection?  How, with the 
abovementioned obligation, we can keep our know-how within the company? .......................................... 20

42. The applicants are advised to have a contributing partner, i.e. an EFPIA company or affiliated entity, or an 
IMI2 JU Associate Partner contributing in-kind as part of consortium. What (estimated percentage of 
planned budget) in-kind contribution should applicants indicate in the project? .......................................... 22 
43. I was wondering about the number of winning consortia (and their average expected budgets) in order to 
put together a consortium.  It's not clear from the call whether there will be one or several winning 
proposals and whether the 45m euros will be granted to one or several consortia. This is will be critical in 
deciding whether to partner with a few or many partners. ........................................................................... 22 
44. Can commercial service providers in diagnostics also participate? ............................................................. 23 
45. In the eForms the row of Partner 1 (Coordinator) is different from the other rows:  - in the column "I" the 
Reimbursement rate is "0" and it is not fillable - the overheads are not calculated and so this cost remains 
"0" - the total of the costs that I enter (Personnel and Other direct costs) automatically appears in the 
columns reserved for EFPIA and associated partners................................................................................. 23

Part A: Questions and answers drafted by IMI2 JU 
1. 
What is the current Call for proposals about?  
Considering the public health and humanitarian implications of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a need for all 
stakeholders across the public and private sectors to collaborate in global efforts to care for those affected, 
contain the outbreak, and develop the much-needed resources to prepare for the future. This Call presents an 
opportunity offered by the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI2 JU) to support 
collaborations of private companies, academia, international organisations, public bodies etc. to accelerate the 
development of therapeutics and diagnostics to tackle the current and future outbreaks.  
In order to avoid duplication with other initiatives and due to several recent announcements regarding novel 
coronavirus vaccine development, IMI2 JU has decided to exclude vaccine development from the scope of this 
Call.  
2. 
What is the total budget of the IMI2 JU Call 21?  
Applicant consortia will be competing for the maximum total financial contribution from IMI2 JU of EUR 
45 000 000.  
Within this budgetary envelope, each proposal must include a sound justification of the requested IMI2 JU 
financial contribution. This should take into account the proposed in-kind contributions from contributing 
partners that will complement the IMI2 JU financial contribution, i.e. EFPIA1 constituents or affiliated entities 
and/or, when relevant, IMI2 Associated Partners (see question 9 on the IM2 JU Associated Partners).  
3. 
All proposals submitted under this Call and evaluated above the 
threshold will be ranked in one single list. Proposals will be invited in 
order of ranking to prepare a Grant Agreement within the limits of the 
available overall budget. What are the reference documents for this Call 
for proposals?  
Applicants are encouraged to study in detail the Call text as well as the following documents:  
 
H2020 Rules for Participation2  
 
Parts A, B and C of the General Annexes to the H2020 Work Programme 2018-20203

4. 
What is the single-stage process?  
The single-stage submission scheme requires that applicants submit a proposal (max. 70 pages – see IMI2 
RIA/IA Proposal Template) for the one and only evaluation stage. Proposals will be submitted by consortia 
composed of applicants requesting IMI2 JU funding and of contributing partners.   
The proposals will be evaluated by independent experts, and the results of this evaluation will be 
communicated to the consortia. Successful consortia will be invited to prepare a Grant Agreement following the 
required modalities.  
Applicants should be aware that under the single-stage submission procedure the threshold for the individual 
criteria (excellence, impact and quality and efficiency of the implementation) is 4 and the overall threshold is 
12. It is important that applicant consortia read the evaluation criteria carefully.  
For this Call, IMI2 JU will not organise hearings with applicants.  
5. 
What are the admissibility criteria for the proposals?  
To be considered admissible, a proposal must comply with the admissibility criteria set out in part B of the 
General Annexes of the H2020 Work Programme 2018-20207.  
Incomplete proposals may be considered inadmissible. In case of an 'obvious clerical error' (e.g. omission to 
submit evidence or information on a non-substantial element of the proposal), IMI2 JU may first ask applicants 
to provide the missing information or supporting documents.  
6. 
What are the eligibility criteria for the proposals?  
To be considered eligible, a proposal must comply with the eligibility criteria set out in part C of the General 
Annexes of the H2020 Work Programme 2018-2020.  
In all cases: a minimum of three independent legal entities established in different Member States or countries 
associated8 to H2020.  
7. 
Do I need a contributing partner, i.e. providing an in-kind 
contribution, in my consortium? Can beneficiaries eligible to receive 
funding instead reduce the funding requested and contribute to the total 
project cost themselves?  
It is not an eligibility criterion to have a contributing partner, i.e. an EFPIA company or affiliated entity, or an 
IMI2 JU Associate Partner contributing in-kind as part of your consortium.   
However, a key element of the expected impact of this Call for proposals is that applicants must maximise the 
value of the IMI2 JU public-private partnership by harnessing support from different stakeholders. This includes 
the mobilisation of resources through the inclusion of contributing partners (e.g. an EFPIA company or 
affiliated entity, or an IMI2 JU Associated Partner), providing contributions (in kind and/or financial), to reflect 
the public-private character of IMI2 JU actions.  
In that respect, it is important to understand that under one of the evaluation criteria (published at: 
http://www.imi.europa.eu/content/overview-imis-calls-how-participate), the expected impact of your 
proposal will be assessed based on what is listed under the section “Expected impact” in the Call text.  
                                                      
7 See footnote 2  
8 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/3cpart/h2020-hi-list-ac_en.pdf   
   
  
  
  
7  
  
This means that your proposal will only score highly under the evaluation criterion ‘Impact’ if the experts 
consider that it meets those expectations. Please also note that the threshold for the evaluation criterion 
‘Impact’ is 4 in a single-stage Call process. It is therefore highly unlikely if not impossible, that your proposal 
will score above threshold if no contributing partner under the IMI2 JU scheme of public-private consortia is 
included.  
The intention is not to reduce the funding available to public partners by revisiting the applicable funding rate 
as established for this Call (100% of the total eligible costs), but to mobilise investments by other stakeholders, 
e.g. private investments, as part of a public-private partnership (PPP).  
8. 
What type of contribution could contributing partners bring to the 
project?  
Contributing partners are usually industry companies that are constituent entities of EFPIA or their affiliated 
entities and/or IMI2 JU Associated Partners which contribute with either in kind or financial contributions. The 
in-kind contribution consists of costs incurred for project implementation which are not reimbursed by IMI2 JU. 
This will typically be human resources (which may be determined in "full-time equivalents" (FTEs)), 
consumables, work outsourced to contract research organisations (CROs) or other service providers, etc. 
Some in-kind resources can originate from non-EU or associated countries (i.e. in practice: work can be carried 
out in these countries).  
The in-kind contribution that contributing partners could bring may include the following (this list is not 
exhaustive):  
Scientific knowledge; drug discovery and development expertise; assay development activities; preclinical 
activities (in vitro/in vivo, toxicology); chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) activities; identification of 
new molecular entities (incl. medicinal chemistry); sample collection; development of diagnostics; clinical trials 
(biostatistics, data-management, clinical supplies, regulatory support).  
In that respect, a number of companies have already expressed their interest to join an applicant consortium 
(this list is not exhaustive):  
 
Abbvie  
 
Astellas  
 
Bayer  
 
Boehringer Ingelheim  
 
E-Pharma  
 
Enyo Pharma  
 
IDbyDNA  
 
Janssen  
 
Merck  
 
Novartis  
 
Pfizer  
 
Special Product's Line S.p.A.  
 
Takeda  
  
Potential applicants are invited to interact with the above mentioned company(ies), using the general mailbox 
set up by EFPIA: covid19@efpia.eu.  
Any other companies interested in contributing with in-kind should also contact EFPIA, using the same 
mailbox.  
Note that no confidential or sensitive information should be included in the messages sent to this email 
address.

As from the launch of the IMI2 JU Call 21, potential applicants are also encouraged to upload their contact 
details on the SEDIA portal.  
9. 
What is an IMI2 JU Associated Partner and what organisations can 
become Associated Partners? Can the process of becoming an IMI2 JU 
Associated Partner be concluded AFTER submission of a proposal, e.g. 
only once evaluated positively?  
Under the IMI2 JU programme, organisations other than EFPIA companies can become IMI2 JU Associated  
Partners. Like EFPIA partners in IMI2 JU projects, Associated Partners do not receive any funding from IMI2 
JU, but contribute to the projects, mainly through in-kind contributions (such as their experts’ time, access to 
resources / equipment). In addition, normally the resources they put into a project are matched by IMI2 JU, 
making this a good way of leveraging precious resources.  
Examples of organisations that could become IMI2 JU Associated Partners include philanthropic organisations 
and charities that run their own health research programmes, as well as organisations working in sectors 
related to healthcare such as ICT, imaging, diagnostics, animal health, etc.  
So far, among others, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome have become Associated 
Partners9.  
Organisations wishing to become IMI2 JU Associated Partners must apply to the IMI2 JU Governing Board 
with a letter of endorsement setting out their acceptance of the IMI2 JU Statutes as well as the details of their 
proposed contribution to IMI2 JU (e.g. in-kind/cash contributions, activities, duration, etc.).   
With reference to the IMI2 JU Call 21, proposals are expected to exploit support from different stakeholders, 
including the mobilisation of funds through the inclusion of contributing partners under the IMI scheme of 
public-private consortia (e.g. an EFPIA company or affiliated entity, or an IMI2 JU Associated Partner).  
In that respect, a contributing partner in a proposal selected for funding under the present Call which is not an 
affiliate or a constituent entity of EFPIA, or an IMI2 JU Associated Partner at the time of the proposal 
submission, is invited to become an affiliate or a constituent entity of EFPIA, or an IMI2 JU Associated Partner 
in accordance with the IMI2 JU Statutes prior to the signature of the relevant Grant Agreement.  
In practical terms, contributing partners may decide to apply for such affiliations when and if the proposal 
where they are participating is selected for funding.  
Where a contributing partner becomes an affiliate or a constituent entity of EFPIA or an IMI2 JU Associated 
Partners, it will have to report annually its contribution to the project in accordance to the IMI2 JU Statutes10.  
10. 
Is my organisation eligible to receive funding?  
Universities and other public research institutions, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), other 
companies having an annual turnover up to EUR 500 million 11, hospitals, healthcare organisations, regulatory 
                                                      
9 https://www.imi.europa.eu/get-involved/associated-partners  
10 Please consult the IMI2 JU guidelines for reporting in kind and financial contributions by Members other than the Union and Associated  
Partners: https://www.imi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/apply-for-funding/call- 
documents/imi2/IMI2_JU_Guidelines_for_reporting_in_kind_and_financial_contributions_by_%20Members_other_%20than_the_%20Uni 
on_%20and_%20Associated_Partners_0.pdf   
11 Independent legal entities having an annual turnover of EUR 500 million or less, not being affiliated entities of companies with an 
annual turnover of more than 500 million; the definition of ‘affiliated entities’ within the meaning of Article 2(1)(2) of Regulation (EU) No 
1290/2013 shall apply mutatis mutandis.  
   
  
  
  
9  
  
agencies, public health authorities, no-profit patients organisations, and others no profit organisations are 
eligible to receive IMI2 JU financial contribution, in accordance with the applicable rules.   
Specifically, legal entities established in a Member State or country associated to H2020 are eligible to receive 
IMI2 JU financial contribution.  
Under exceptional circumstances, legal entities from countries other than those set out above (i.e. third 
countries), such as the People’s Republic of China might also be eligible for IMI2 JU funding should their 
participation be evaluated as essential for the realisation of the project’s objectives.   
Proposals should justify the need for IMI2 JU funding for organisations in third countries.   
11. 
Is cooperation with other organisations or on-going projects 
envisaged?  
Considering the public health and humanitarian implications, synergies and complementarities with ongoing 
efforts in the COVID-19 field are expected to maximise impact.  
Therefore synergies and complementarities are expected with relevant national, European and non-European 
initiatives (including suitable biological and medical sciences research infrastructures5) in order to incorporate 
past achievements, available data and lessons learnt where possible, thus avoiding unnecessary overlap, and 
duplication of efforts and funding. In particular, applicants are expected to collaborate with any relevant project 
or initiative targeting the current COVID-19 outbreak supported by the European Commission, CEPI, 
Wellcome, BARDA, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others.  
Where relevant, applicants might consider the advantages of the use of the European supercomputing centres 
(PRACE network) to accelerate the process of diagnosis and therapeutics research, using the exiting high-end 
computing, data and simulation resources.  
Proposals covering investigations of therapeutic should consider engaging with the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) which has activated its plan for emerging health threats. The latter includes the possibility for 
fast-tracked Scientific Advice [3].   
The consortia selected through this Call are expected to cooperate with each other and share their learnings 
for the purpose of achieving the objectives of their respective actions, and to maximise their impact. Therefore, 
all grants awarded under this Call will be complementary grants. Consequently, the respective options under 
Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the IMI2 JU Model Grant Agreement12 will apply.  
Accordingly, the relevant consortia will conclude collaboration agreement(s) to ensure the exchange of 
relevant information, exploration of synergies, and collaboration where appropriate.   
12. 
Are there any special provisions regarding the Intellectual Property 
(IP) regime under the IMI2 JU Call 21?  
Where relevant under this Call, applicant consortia are expected to bring into the project assets which are 
owned by one of the beneficiaries participating in the proposal, for use in the treatment of patients diagnosed 
with COVID-19. These assets could include approved therapies or compounds in development or for 
repurposing. Clinical results that are generated from the assets tested will be owned by the generating 
beneficiary(ies). However, these results may be improvements (or directly related) to the assets.   
The consortium should recognise the requirements of Article 26.2 of the IMI2 JU Model Grant Agreement with 
respect to jointly generated results. All beneficiaries should be aware that when negotiating the consortium 
agreement each beneficiary may propose all possible safeguarding provisions with respect to the rights to 
results generated from their assets. For instance in the consortium agreement, the relevant beneficiaries may

10  
  
agree that, when requested by a beneficiary (e.g. an EFPIA partner) that is the owner of a pre-existing asset 
(i.e. background of the project), the ownership of results (including clinical results) generated by any other 
beneficiary, relating to the pre-existing background – when and only where not jointly owned according to 
Article 26.2 of the IMI2 JU Model Grant Agreement – will be transferred under the terms of the consortium 
agreement to the owner of the pre-existing asset. Such contractual arrangements may state that, e.g. such a 
transfer would be at no cost, if so requested by the owner of the pre-existing asset.  
13. 
Are there any conditions on data management and dissemination 
within the IMI2 JU Call 21?  
In the context of a Public Health Emergency, grant beneficiaries will be subject to additional requirements with 
respect to the timely sharing of data. Beneficiaries in grants awarded under this Call for proposals must make 
available their research data, at the latest within 30 days after it has been generated, through open access or, 
if agreed by IMI2 JU or the European Commission, by giving access rights to those third parties that need the 
research data to address the public health emergency. Therefore, the relevant option of Article 29.3of the IMI2 
JU model Grant Agreement will be applied.  
Applicants should be aware that data must be deposited in a relevant established international data platform, 
such as those of the WHO, or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).   
In addition, applicants should be aware that beneficiaries in grants awarded in this Call are expected to apply 
the principles established in the Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergency  
14. 
Which rules apply to the UK legal entities joining a proposal under 
the IMI2 JU Call 21?  
The Withdrawal Agreement as agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom entered into 
force on 1 February 2020. In overall terms, on the basis of the Withdrawal Agreement, UK-based legal entities 
will continue to be fully eligible to participate and receive funding in the current 2014-2020 EU programmes, 
including Horizon 2020 and IMI2 JU, as if the UK were a Member State until the closure of these programmes, 
unless security considerations apply. This means that UK beneficiaries can continue – without interruption – to 
receive grants awarded under the current and previous multiannual financial frameworks (MFFs) until their end 
dates, even if these are after 2020. Accordingly, UK-based legal entities will be fully eligible to apply, 
participate and receive JU funding under the IMI2 JU Call 21.  
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
11  
  
Part B: Questions received by applicants and answered by IMI2 
JU 
15. 
Is the development of a COVID 19 test and POC system eligible for 
an IMI grant application? 
Please refer to the Scope section (page 6) of the Call text, where diagnostics is specified: 
 
Development of diagnostics, ensuring rapid evaluation of candidates based on existing technologies. 
Diagnostic tests will be essential for clinical trials of new or repurposed drugs, to help stratify patients and 
assess treatment efficiency (surrogate endpoint such as viral clearance). 
 
Development of fast and reliable tools that go beyond the state of the art for detection of COVID-19 
carriers and symptomatic individuals suspected of COVID-19 infection. These are essential and of utmost 
importance to manage the outbreak, isolate patients at risk, and treat people accordingly. It is crucial to 
differentiate and identify respiratory pathogens with similar clinical symptoms (e.g. flu, respiratory syncytial 
virus, other viruses or bacteria) and/or detect emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. This can be achieved 
through point-of-care (POC) testing or centralised testing. 
16. 
Is there a submission template for Call 21? 
This is the template for Call 21, which can be downloaded from the Call documents section on IMI’s website. 
17. 
Are US universities eligible for Call 21? 
As the US is a ‘Third Country’, a university from the US is eligible to participate in IMI projects. This 
participation however is separate from its eligibility for funding from IMI (see below). If participation is planned, 
the US participant should satisfy itself that it will be able to sign and abide by the provisions of the IMI2 Grant 
Agreement (link below) and the project consortium agreement (which will be prepared by the applicant 
consortium themselves). 
US University eligibility for funding: 
The conditions of Call 21 specify that participants established in a third country are eligible to take part in IMI 
actions but are not automatically eligible for funding. They may exceptionally receive funding from the IMI2 JU 
provided that their participation is deemed ‘essential’ by the IMI2 JU to carry out the action.  
This essentiality should be of such a character that the given IMI2 JU project would be unable to achieve its 
objectives without the inclusion of that entity, e.g. a similar expertise is not available within the EU or H2020 
associated countries. 
Thus, to be eligible for funding, such entities from third countries must demonstrate that their contribution is 
essential to the project. Such essentiality can be defined as provision of the following: 
 
outstanding competence/expertise;  
 
access to research infrastructure; 
 
access to particular geographical environments;  
 
access to data. 
The relevance/essentiality of the above is usually established with the other applicants when an applicant 
consortium is being formed and confirmed by the independent experts evaluating the submitted proposal.  
To conclude, in order for a third country legal entity to be funded in the IMI2 JU context, it has to fulfil the 
conditions for funding applying to organisations from EU and H2020 associated countries, as defined in Article 
1 of Regulation 622/2014. 
   
  
  
  
12  
  
18. 
Is a consortium made of research institutions, SMEs and medical 
centres belonging to three different EU member states eligible? 
Regulation (EU) 1290/2013 (‘The H2020 Rules of Participation’ or ‘ROP’) state that the following minimum 
conditions shall apply: 
a. 
At least three legal entities shall participate in an action; 
b. 
three legal entities shall each be established in a different Member State or associated country; and 
c. 
the three legal entities referred to in point (b) shall be independent of each other within the meaning of 
Article 8.  
A 'legal entity' is any natural person, or any legal person created and recognised as such under national law, 
Union law or international law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise 
rights and be subject to obligations (ROP, Article 2: ‘Definitions’)  
Article 8 of the ROP lays out the conditions under which legal entities can be considered to under the 
direct/indirect control of another legal entity (this may be of relevance).  
We would therefore suggest that the prospective participants satisfy the eligibility criteria.  
19. 
Who is expected to drive the process of assembling a consortium 
and an application for the single-stage call? 
Will the reference person be a Coordinator, academic or SME, let’s say in 
the “public” side, or a project Leader in the EFPIA/private domain? An 
entity willing to participate as a beneficiary, to whom has to address its 
contribution offer? One in the public domain possibly acting as a 
coordinator, or and EFPIA partner? 
IMI does not mandate how applicant consortia organise themselves. The task of assembling a consortium (and 
then preparing an application) is solely in the hands of the applicants themselves. You may find further 
information under #6, #7 and #11 of this Questions and Answers document, as well on the IMI page on ‘Finding 
Partners’ useful: 
https://www.imi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/apply-for-funding/open-
calls/Call21_QandA_FINAL.pdfhttps://www.imi.europa.eu/apply-funding/general-overview/finding-partners  
20. 
Is there a fixed duration for Call 21 projects? 
The call text includes no fixed duration for the project, this is left to applicants whereby the duration should 
accurately reflect the approach set out in the applicant proposal. We would refer you to the topic text (link 
below), specifically to ‘Indicative duration of the action’ (page 8).  
https://www.imi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/apply-for-funding/open-
calls/IMI2Call%2021_Coronavirus_CallText.pdf 
21. 
Is there a functional mailbox for the applicants to contact 
companies interested in joining an applicant consortium? 
EFPIA has set up this functional mailbox covid19@efpia.eu in order to facilitate the communication between 
applicants and the companies interested in joining an applicant consortium. 
   
  
  
  
13  
  
22. 
How many proposals will be funded? 
There is no set number. This will depend upon the funding utilised by the top ranked proposal(s) and outlined in 
the budget(s). 
23. 
How many companies can be part of a consortium? 
IMI2 JU sets no guidelines for the maximum size of a consortium. However, IMI2 JU requires that a Consortium 
contains a minimum of three independent legal entities established in different Member States or Associated 
Countries. 
24. 
We are preparing a consortium for the coronavirus IMI call, and are 
wondering about the budget, could you give us any range of budget we 
should aim at? 
"According to the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI 2 JU)-Call 21 text, the applicant 
consortia are expected to address at least one of the objectives of the topic. These consortia will be competing 
for the maximum total financial contribution from IMI2 JU up to EUR 45 000 000.  
Within this budgetary envelope, each proposal must include a sound justification of the requested IMI2 JU 
financial contribution. This should take into account the proposed in-kind contributions from contributing 
partners that will complement the IMI2 JU financial contribution, i.e. EFPIA constituents or affiliated entities 
and/or, when relevant, IMI2 JU Associated Partners.  
The indicative budget must be drafted as close as possible to the real estimated costs, taking into account the 
tasks foreseen and cost efficiency considerations. Please bear in mind that according to the IMI2 JU “Manual 
for submission, evaluation and grant award”, proposals with an inflated budget are likely to receive a lower 
score. 
Award of the grants will be made on the basis of this ranking, subject to the availability of budget. 
You will find more information under the links below. 
IMI 2 JU-Call 21:

documents/imi2/IMI2_ManualForSubmission_v1.7_November2018.pdf  
25. 
Should I contact EFPIA during the drafting phase of the proposal? 
Being a single-stage call, the submission scheme requires that a proposal (max. 70 pages) is submitted by a 
consortium composed of applicants requesting IMI2 JU funding, and contributing partners, e.g. EFPIA 
companies and/or an IMI2 JU Associated Partner. Therefore, you need to reach out and integrate the 
contributing partners in your consortium before the submission of your proposal.  
Please refer to #7 for further information on the involvement of a contributing partner, i.e. an EFPIA company or 
affiliated entity, or an IMI2 JU Associate Partner contributing in-kind as part of your consortium. 
 
   
  
  
  
14  
  
26. 
What is the required TRL (Technology Readiness Level) to enter the 
proposal? Is there a start TRL level and/or a level that needs to be 
reached during the project? 
It is up to the applicants to show how they will address at least one of the objectives of the call topic and 
achieve at least one of the key deliverables listed and therefore demonstrate their capacity as well as the 
readiness to progress as rapidly as possible to ensure maximum impact. 
27. 
Are private companies financed at 100% of the total cost of the 
project?  
The IMI2 JU rules and conditions of Call 21 specify that only certain types of legal entities are eligible for IMI JU 
funding. 
Concerning private companies based in EU and H2020 associated countries, those defined in Article 1 of 
Regulation 622/2014 will be eligible to receive funding:  
(i) 
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and other companies with an annual turnover of EUR 500 
million or less, the latter not being affiliated entities of companies with an annual turnover of more than 500 
million; the definition of ‘affiliated entities’ within the meaning of Article 2(1)(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 
shall apply mutatis mutandis;  
(ii) 
non-profit organisations, including those carrying out research or technological development as one of 
their main objectives or those that are patient organizations. 
If eligible for receiving IMI2 JU funding, the direct costs incurred during execution of project tasks will be 
reimbursed at 100% rate, increased by 25% indirect costs. 
 
28. 
Is it up to the consortium to decide how to split the grant between 
partners or are there any limitations? 
According to the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI 2 JU) Call 21 text, the applicant 
consortia are expected to address at least one of the objectives of the topic. These consortia will be competing 
for the maximum total financial contribution from IMI2 JU up to EUR 45 000 000.  
Within this budgetary envelope, each proposal must include a sound justification of the requested IMI2 JU 
financial contribution.  
This should take into account the proposed in-kind contributions from contributing partners (i.e. EFPIA 
constituents or affiliated entities and/or, when relevant, IMI2 JU Associated Partners) that will complement the 
IMI2 JU financial contribution. 
The proposal estimated budget should be drafted in line with the proposal objectives and activities, and cost 
efficiency considerations. It should present the estimated costs and requested JU contribution for applicant 
requesting JU funding, plus the estimated costs for contributing partners not receiving JU funding. The proposal 
estimated budget has to be broken-down for each member of the consortium, both receiving and not receiving 
JU funding. This budget will be reviewed, as part of your proposal, by the panel of experts during the 
evaluation. 
Please note that the IMI2 JU funding will eventually only reimburse eligible costs incurred in the implementation 
of the funded project.  
Thus, the consortium is responsible to decide about the allocation of the grant within its members. 
Nevertheless, the IMI2 JU will only accept and reimburse eligible costs actually incurred during the project 
which pertain to project tasks and activities necessary to achieve the project objectives.  
 
   
  
  
  
15  
  
29. 
Are non-EU in-kind-contributions allowed in Call 21? If yes, is there 
a maximum per project? Will it affect negatively the evaluation score if 
the project includes a high number of non-EU in-kind-contributions? 
Under the IMI2 JU legal framework, in accordance with article 3 of the IMI2 JU Regulation EU 557/2014, the 
IMI2 JU funding is matching in-kind (i.e. costs incurred by contributing partner for project implementation) and 
financial contributions which are normally provided by EFPIA constituent or affiliated entities and/or IMI2 JU 
Associated Partners. 
In relation to in-kind contribution consisting of costs incurred in third countries, i.e. other than EU Member 
states or H2020 Associated countries, these must meet specific conditions established under Article 4 of the 
IMI2 JU Regulation, EU 557/2014: 
- they must be justified and relevant to the IMI2 JU objectives and 
- they shall not exceed 30% of the total eligible costs incurred by all contributing partners at the level of the IMI2 
JU programme. 
Please note that costs for in-kind contribution shall be deemed to be incurred in third countries (i.e. non-EU in-
kind-contribution) if the underlying activities are carried out in third countries irrespective of the place where the 
contributing partner is established.  
More information regarding the contributing partners’ contributions and reporting obligations can be found in the 
following document: 
IMI2 JU guidelines for reporting in kind and financial contributions by Members other than the Union and 
Associated Partners 
In-kind contributions must be relevant for achieving proposal objectives under the IMI2 JU Call 21. They will be 
assessed, as any other proposed activity, against the evaluation criteria of excellence, expected impact and 
quality and efficiency of implementation. Thus, in principle, relevant and justified in-kind contributions should 
not be negatively evaluated for being provided by third countries. At the same time, there is no maximum 
amount of non EU in-kind contribution established for this Call21. 
 
30. 
Do you have a suggestion on how to join to other forming 
consortia? 
With regards to forming consortia, you may find the following resources useful: 
https://www.imi.europa.eu/apply-funding/general-overview/finding-partners 
 
31. 
Is it possible to participate to more than one consortia? 
There is no legal rule preventing a partner from participating in two (or more) proposals from competing 
consortia, provided that the entity meets all requirements to participate in an IMI2 JU call for proposals. 
However, a call for proposals being a competitive process, please be aware that multiple participations might 
raise concerns within the competing consortia, mainly on matters of confidentiality and exchange of information 
useful to build the consortium.  
32. 
Are clinical trials a pre-requisite for Call 21? 
Clinical Trials are not considered a prerequisite for this call. 
   
  
  
  
16  
  
33. 
My proposal covers the development of a potential therapeutic 
against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Do I need to contact 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA)?  
As per the call topic text, proposals covering investigation of a therapeutic should engage with the EMA to 
ensure adequacy from a regulatory point of view. 
The EMA has recently announced that they provide full fee waivers for scientific advice applications from 
developers of potential therapeutics (to treat the disease) against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). 
Developers of potential therapeutics against COVID-19 should contact EMA as soon as possible with 
information about their proposed development, by emailing 2019-ncov@ema.europa.eu. In a first round of 
discussions, EMA can provide preliminary informal comments and feedback on the development. This will then 
allow EMA to identify the products which are mature enough to benefit from fast-track scientific advice, to 
guarantee best use of this tool. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with this fast-track scientific advice, 
EMA can give developers prompt guidance and direction on the best methods and study designs to generate 
robust information on how well a medicine works and how safe it is. More information can be found on the EMA 
webpage. 
Therefore in your proposal, you should provide information on any interaction that may have already occurred, 
or propose a plan for such interaction. 
 
34. 
Can management companies be involved in IMI projects?  
According to Article 41.2 (b)(i) ‘Internal roles and responsibilities’ of the IMI2 JU Model grant agreement (MGA), 
the coordinator: 
 
monitors that the action is implemented properly. The requirements of proper implementation are defined in 
Article 7 of the IMI2 JU Annotated GA and consist of obligation to carry out the action, especially the 
research work, as described in Annex I to GA, and to comply with all the other provisions of the GA and all 
the applicable provisions of EU, international and national law; 
 
acts as the intermediary for all communications between the beneficiaries and the JU;  
 
requests and review any documents or information required by the JU and verify their completeness and 
correctness before passing them on to the JU;  
 
submits the deliverables and reports to the JU; 
 
ensures that all payments are made to the other beneficiaries without unjustified delay; 
 
informs the JU of the amounts paid to each beneficiary. 
 
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary or third 
party. Exceptionally, coordinators that are secondary or higher education establishments or public bodies may 
delegate the administration of the payments to another legal entity. 
In other words, the responsibility for carrying-out the tasks described above is exclusively in hands of the 
coordinator. Nevertheless, if there is a management company participating in such consortium, it will be able to 
assist and support the coordinator with the administrative and other tasks. This separation of duties should be 
   
  
  
  
17  
  
clearly described in the Annex I to GA, and in particular in the dedicated management work package. 
Please also note that under IMI2 JU there is the possibility to identify, besides the coordinator, a project leader. 
This is explained in the IMI2 JU Annotated grant agreement, particularly in the introduction (IV.D -Partnering 
with EFPIA beneficiaries/other large industrial beneficiaries not receiving JU funding: project scientific 
governance and leadership) and in annotations of article 41.3 par. 2. ‘The coordinator’s roles and 
responsibilities’. 
As a conclusion, a member of consortium (e.g. a management company) can collaborate on execution of 
exclusive coordinator’s management tasks, in a way as described in the Annex I. But only the coordinator shall 
be responsible and accountable for those tasks.

35. 
If Call 21 requires open access and data sharing within 30 days, how 
do we ensure IP protection as we likely will not be able to file patents so 
quickly? 
We envision the project generating significant amount of ‘digital research data’. 
We further understand that beneficiaries may seek to utilise this research data outside the project, in support of 
patent applications or other IPR related/commercial activities. 
For clarity, IMI2 JU Annotated grant agreement (hereafter IMI2 JU AGA) define digital research data as follows: 
information in digital form (in particular facts or numbers), collected to be examined and used as a basis for 
reasoning, discussion or calculation. This includes statistics, results of experiments, measurements, 
observations resulting from fieldwork, survey results, interview recordings and images. Only data that are 
generated by beneficiaries in the course of the action are concerned.  
Conditions related to data sharing in Part L of General annexes to the H2020 Work programme are applicable 
mutatis mutandis to IMI2 JU actions. According to the text, open access to digital research data (or data 
sharing) means making possible for end-users via a repository and free-of-charge to access, mine, exploit, 
reproduce and disseminate the data concerned. 
In general terms, the participants in IMI2 JU actions engage in data sharing as defined in Article 29.3.1a AGA. 
The text applies to two types of digital research data: 
 
the data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications and associated metadata (i.e. 
data describing the deposited research data) and  
 
other data and associated metadata, as specified by the beneficiaries in their data management plan 
(DMP).  
Data management plan is a deliverable of the project which is drafted by the consortium and submitted for 
acceptance by IMI2 JU. 
In addition to obligations Article 29.3.1a, the grant agreements signed following the IMI2 - Call 21 will also 
contain specific obligations on data sharing arising from Article 29.3.1c AGA for health actions targeting public 
   
  
  
  
18  
  
health emergencies. The text requires data sharing of any type of quality controlled digital research data and 
associated metadata at the latest within 30 days after it has been generated. 
As an exceptional measure, the beneficiaries might replace the open access obligation of Article 29.3.1c AGA 
by specific access rights to third parties that need the research data to address the public health emergency. 
Such limitation would be granted by IMI2 JU or the Commission, upon request from the grant beneficiary. 
Public health emergencies are those declared under the international rules, EU rules such as Decision 
1082/2013 or under the applicable national framework.  
It should be noted that the data sharing obligation of Article 29.3 AGA does not apply to specific categories of 
data, subject to distinct legal rules. These are, inter alia, personal data, subject to Article 39 AGA, data covered 
by confidentiality obligation and subject to Article 36 AGA or by obligation to protect results, subject to Article 
27 AGA.  
Besides, the data generated during the project and falling under the definition of ‘results’ as defined by Article 
26 AGA is comprehensively subject to IMI2 IPR rules. For results which can be expected to be commercially or 
industrially exploitable, the conditions of Article 27 AGA to examine and possibly seek an appropriate form of 
protection, such as patent, trademark, copyrights, trade-secret or confidentiality agreements, will be relevant. 
Understandably, the specific requirements of granting access rights to results for other consortium partners, 
IMI2 JU and third parties as laid out in Article 26, 31 AGA would then be applicable. 
As a conclusion, the data sharing obligation under IMI2 - Call 21 will apply according to conditions set in 
Articles 29.3.1a and 29.3.1c AGA and is relevant to data falling under the AGA definition of digital research 
data. Such data will be described in the Data management plan (DMP), provided preferably with the proposal 
or at the latest before the grant signature. DMP will indicate details on what data the project will generate, how 
it will be curated, exploited, made accessible for verification and re-use. DMP will be subject to IMI2 JU scrutiny 
and also to further modifications according to the project execution path. The data sharing does not change the 
obligation to protect specific data, such as personal, confidential data or those necessary to protect results. As 
an exception, beneficiary might request replacing the general data sharing obligation by specific rights granted 
to third parties that need the research data in order to address the public health emergency. Such request must 
be agreed upon by IMI2 JU or the Commission and include rights to access, mine, exploit and reproduce the 
data free of charge.

36. 
Can an institution participate in more than one consortia? 
There is no legal rule preventing a partner from participating in two (or more) proposals from competing 
consortia, provided that the entity meets all requirements to participate in an IMI2 JU call for proposals. 
However, being a call for proposals a competitive process, please be aware that multiple participations might 
raise concerns within the competing consortia, mainly on matters of confidentiality and exchange of information 
useful to build the consortium. 
37. 
As I understand after reading all the information, we need to submit 
only the application through the Funding and Tenders portal with no 
additional documents. Do we need to provide at this stage (with the 
proposal) a collaboration agreement? 
The requirement for a submission in response to this single stage IMI2 Call 21 is the electronic submission of 
the proposal in the Funding & and Tenders portal. The proposals are submitted by the coordinator. 
A collaboration agreement is only required in case your proposal will be successful. In such a case, your 
consortium will have to agree a collaboration agreement with the other consortia selected under this call 21 
since all grant agreements signed under this call will be complementary grants. The collaboration agreement 
must ensure all consortia to cooperate with each other and share their learnings for the purpose of achieving 
the objectives of their respective actions, in order to maximise the impact. 
38. 
I am a bit unsure which template to use for this application as it is 
single stage and involves a clinical trial in our case. Could you please 
advise? 
The template used for submission in a single stage call for proposals is the same as the template for the 
second stage in a two stage procedure. 
For this reason, you will find it on the webpage dedicated to essential IMI2 Call documents (link below), under 
the heading: 
‘Research and Innovation Actions - second stage proposal in a two-stage procedure and single-stage 
procedure.’ 
https://www.imi.europa.eu/apply-funding/call-documents/imi2-call-documents 
 
The template for essential information for proposals including clinical trials / studies / investigations can be 
found under the link below: 
https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/templ/h2020_tmpl-clinical-studies_2018-
2020_en.pdf 
This guide provides detailed explanations on the required information, the word version of the template is then 
available in the submission environment. 
In addition, you will find detailed information on submission of proposals in the IMI2 JU Manual for submission, 
evaluation and grant award:  
https://www.imi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/apply-for-funding/call-

39. 
I am working on a proposal for IMI-2 call 21, but in order to make my 
project more complete I would like to perform some regulatory preclinical 
test. Could you please be so kind to let me know if this contribution could 
be performed by sub-contractors, and if yes what is the maximum 
admissible cost for a subcontractor? 
According to Article 13 of IMI2 JU Annotated grant agreement (AGA), subcontracts concern the implementation 
of action specific tasks, which are described in the Description of action (DoA). The subcontracted tasks may 
only cover a limited part of the action; there is no financial limit.  
Any task necessary for the action can be subcontracted, if the required expertise is not available within the 
consortium. Additionally, the beneficiaries receiving IMI2 funding must ensure meeting all conditions 
established in Article 13 IMI2 JU MGA, such as the competitive selection of subcontractor, ensuring best value 
for money and respecting rules on conflict of interest.  
Consequently, if the pre-clinical study is part of the project, described in DoA and no other participant and 
carry-out the task, it can be performed by a subcontractor. 
Please note that, subcontracted activities, as any other of the proposed activities will be subject to the 
evaluation of the panel of expert according to the applicable evaluation criteria. 
For further information, you may also consult the relevant annotations in the IMI2 JU Annotated Grant 
Agreement.   
40. 
I have read that the minimum requirement is three partners from 3 
different EU member states or H2020 Associated countries. How are the 
requirements in regards to numbers of partners from the same country, is 
there a limit? 
The minimum eligibility condition for participation in a Research & innovation action (RIA) under this call is 
indeed at least three legal entities. Each of the three entities must be established in a different EU member 
state or H2020 associated country. All three entities must be independent of each other. 
On the other hand, there are no maximum limits on number of participants based in the same country as far as 
the minimum eligibility condition is fulfilled. In fact these parameters should match up to the capacities and 
excellence brought to the consortium and also to the operational capacity to carry-out tasks foreseen in the 
proposals. 
41. 
Data sharing versus intellectual property (IP) rights protection 
Within publicized documentation it is stated that beneficiaries in grants 
awarded under this topic must make available their research data, at the 
latest within 30 days after it has been generated. What kind of data the 
beneficiary is obligate to publicize and is it up to beneficiary decision 
which data cannot be shared due to IP rights protection?  
How, with the abovementioned obligation, we can keep our know-how 
within the company? 
Concerning your question on the interplay between the data-sharing obligation and intellectual property rights 
(IPR) protection, we envision the project generating significant amount of ‘digital research data’. 
 
We further understand that beneficiaries may seek to utilise this research data outside the project, in support of 
protecting their technical know-how, such as patent applications, business secret or protection of other IP 
   
  
  
  
21  
  
rights. 
 
For clarity, IMI2 JU Annotated grant agreement (hereafter IMI2 JU AGA) define digital research data as follows: 
information in digital form (in particular facts or numbers), collected to be examined and used as a basis for 
reasoning, discussion or calculation. This includes statistics, results of experiments, measurements, 
observations resulting from fieldwork, survey results, interview recordings and images. Only data that are 
generated by beneficiaries in the course of the action are concerned.  
 
Conditions related to data sharing in Part L of General annexes to the H2020 Work programme are applicable 
mutatis mutandis to IMI2 JU actions. According to the text, open access to digital research data (or data 
sharing) means making possible for end-users via a repository and free-of-charge to access, mine, exploit, 
reproduce and disseminate the data concerned. 
 
In general terms, the participants in IMI2 JU actions engage in data sharing as defined in Article 29.3.1a of IMI2 
JU Model grant agreement (MGA). The text applies to two types of digital research data: 
- the data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications and associated metadata (i.e. data 
describing the deposited research data) and  
- other data and associated metadata, as specified by the beneficiaries in their data management plan (DMP).  
Data management plan is a deliverable of the project which is drafted by the consortium and submitted for 
acceptance by IMI2 JU. 
 
In addition to obligations Article 29.3.1a, the grant agreements signed following the IMI2 - Call 21 will also 
contain specific obligations on data sharing arising from Article 29.3.1c MGA for health actions targeting public 
health emergencies. The text requires data sharing of any type of quality controlled digital research data and 
associated metadata at the latest within 30 days after it has been generated. 
 
As an exceptional measure, the beneficiaries might replace the open access obligation of Article 29.3.1c MGA 
by specific access rights to third parties that need the research data to address the public health emergency. 
Such limitation would be granted by IMI2 JU or the Commission. 
 
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the data-sharing obligation of Article 29.3a and c MGA does not apply to 
specific categories of data, subject to distinct legal rules. These are, inter alia, personal data, subject to Article 
39 MGA, data covered by confidentiality obligation and subject to Article 36 MGA or by obligation to protect 
results (e.g. IP generated in the action) , subject to Article 27 MGA.  
 
Besides, the data generated during the project and falling under the definition of ‘results’ as defined by Article 
26 MGA is comprehensively subject to IMI2 IPR rules. For results which can be expected to be commercially or 
industrially exploitable, the conditions of Article 27 AGA to examine and possibly seek an appropriate form of 
protection, such as patent, trademark, copyrights, trade-secret or confidentiality agreements, will be relevant. 
Understandably, the specific requirements of granting access rights to results for other consortium partners, 
IMI2 JU and third parties as laid out in Article 26, 31 AGA would then become applicable. 
 
As a conclusion, the data-sharing obligation under IMI2 - Call 21 will apply according to conditions set in 
Articles 29.3.1a and 29.3.1c MGA and is relevant to data falling under the AGA definition of digital research 
data. Such data will be described in the Data management plan (DMP), provided preferably with the proposal 
or at the latest before the grant signature. DMP will indicate details on what data the project will generate, how 
it will be curated, exploited, made accessible for verification and re-use. DMP will be subject to IMI2 JU scrutiny 
and also to further modifications according to the project execution path. The data sharing does not change the 
obligation to protect specific data, such as personal, confidential data or those necessary to protect results, by 
seeking for example IPR registration. As an exception, beneficiary might request replacing the general data-
sharing obligation by specific rights granted to third parties that need the research data in order to address the 
public health emergency. Such request must be agreed upon by IMI2 JU or the Commission and include rights 
to access, mine, exploit and reproduce the data free of charge. 
   
  
  
  
22  
  
42. The applicants are expected to have a contributing partner, i.e. an 
EFPIA company or affiliated entity, or an IMI2 JU Associate Partner 
contributing in-kind as part of consortium. What percentage of the 
proposal estimated budget should be provided by contributing 
partners, in form of in-kind or financial contribution?  
As you might know, the public-private partnership (PPP) principle attributes a significant role that EFPIA, other 
large industrial beneficiaries and IMI2 JU Associated Partners (AP) play in the implementation of the IMI2 JU 
actions.  
The in-kind and financial contributions provided by EFPIA/AP beneficiaries are being matched, at IMI2 JU 
programme level, with the IMI2 JU funding provided to beneficiaries receiving funding.  
In relation to your question, for IMI2 JU Call 21 there is no strict proportion in a consortium between the budget 
for participants receiving IMI2 JU funding and participants providing in-kind contribution. Nevertheless, the 
contributions from EFPIA/AP should be in line and proportioned to the scientific objectives and related activities 
described in the proposal. Additionally, the public-private partnership nature of the IMI2 JU should be taken into 
consideration when building the consortium and the proposal budget. 
43. 
I was wondering about the number of winning consortia (and their 
average expected budgets) in order to put together a consortium.  
It's not clear from the call whether there will be one or several winning 
proposals and whether the 45m euros will be granted to one or several 
consortia. This is will be critical in deciding whether to partner with a few 
or many partners.  
As for your question on how many projects will be funded and what is the average expected budget, this 
depends on the content, quality and requested IMI2 contribution of the submitted proposals.  
As you might know, the scope of the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI 2 JU)-Call 21 is to 
advance knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and is articulated around four objectives: 
 
Development of antivirals as well as other types of therapeutics, 
 
Development of therapeutics to address the current and/or future coronavirus outbreaks, 
 
Development of diagnostics, 
 
Development of fast and reliable tools that go beyond the state of the art for detection of COVID-19  
According to the IMI2 Call 21 text, the applicant consortia are expected to address at least one of the objectives 
of the topic. Hence, when deciding on the composition of the consortium, it is critical that the participation of 
each partner, and the tasks attributed to it, must be efficient and necessary for the project objectives. In 
particular, the requested funding must correspond to the content of the tasks foreseen in the proposal and 
should also correspond to the extent of topic scope covered and number of objectives addressed. 
The applicant consortia in this call will be competing for the maximum total financial contribution from IMI2 JU 
up to EUR 45 000 000. Within this budgetary envelope, each proposal must be drafted as close as possible to 
the real estimated costs and include a sound justification of the requested IMI2 JU financial contribution. In fact, 
IMI2 JU Manual for submission indicates that proposals with an inflated budget are likely to receive a lower 
score.  
Award of the grants will be made on the basis of this ranking, subject to the availability of budget. 
As a conclusion, the proposal budget should be based on the real estimated costs of the tasks described. The 
global envelope of EUR 45 000 000 will be awarded following the ranking order based on proposal(s) 
   
  
  
  
23  
  
requested funding, as evaluated by the panel. The number of proposals eventually funded will depend from the 
amount of JU funding requested by the highest ranked proposal(s). 
44. 
Can commercial service providers in diagnostics also participate? 
Concerning the eligibility to participate in the submission of a proposal, we refer to Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 
1290/2013 (the H2020 Rules for participation). The text states that, any legal entity, regardless of its place of 
establishment, may participate in an action provided that the conditions laid down in this Regulation have been 
met, together with any conditions laid down in the relevant work plan. 
However, the participation of each consortium partner, and the tasks attributed to it, must be necessary for the 
project objectives. In fact, the scope of the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI 2 JU)-Call 21 
is to advance knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, knowing that the proposals must address at least of the following 
objectives: 
 
Development of antivirals as well as other types of therapeutics, 
 
Development of therapeutics to address the current and/or future coronavirus outbreaks, 
 
Development of diagnostics, 
 
Development of fast and reliable tools that go beyond the state of the art for detection of COVID-19.  
In addition, and concerning commercial companies, Article 1 of Regulation 622/2014 establishing IMI2 Rules 
for participation, declares that following entities will be eligible for IMI2 funding: 
 
legal entities established in a Member State or an associated country, or created under Union law; and 
 
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and other companies with an annual turnover of EUR 500 
million or less, the latter not being affiliated entities of companies with an annual turnover of more than 500 
million. 
If eligible for funding, the reimbursement rates are 100% of the direct eligible costs incurred (i.e. no business 
rate) during the project implementation, increased by 25% overheads. 
As a conclusion, if the commercial services providers can provide tasks aligned with the research objectives of 
the proposal and necessary for this Research & innovation action, then they would be welcome to participate. If 
fulfilling the conditions of eligibility for funding, their costs could be reimbursed at the rates indicated above. 
45. 
In the eForms the row of Partner 1 (Coordinator) is different from the 
other rows:  
- in the column "I" the Reimbursement rate is "0" and it is not fillable 
- the overheads are not calculated and so this cost remains "0" 
- the total of the costs that I enter (Personnel and Other direct costs) 
automatically appears in the columns reserved for EFPIA and associated 
partners. 
In the proposal e-forms, under ‘Administrative data of participating organisations’ for your entity, you probably 
selected “Member of EFPIA” or “IMI2 Associated partners”. 
If so, the tool considers your organisations as a contributing partner and therefore its budget fall under in kind 
contribution with no indirect costs. 
We advise to verify the Administrative data of your organisation and modify as necessary. 
It is not possible to undo the selection in those fields, it is only possible to modify them.  
  
   
  
  
  
24  
  
Therefore, in the interest of time also considering that the submission deadline is on March 31, their advice is 
either: 
a) to select one of the first three options that will configure the same type of budget table as the one 
needed for UNIFI. All first three options are for beneficiaries receiving funding, thus you can include 
UNIFI budget as relevant. These options are selected in red below.  Any correction of the applicant 
status will be dealt during the Grant Agreement Preparation in case the proposal is successful, OR 
b) to start the submission again, i.e. preparing a new application, 
 
Please note that option a) is the less time consuming solution.
