 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT BETWEEN A 
UNIVERSITY OR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION (IES in Spanish) AND A DELIVERY 
ENTITY FOR PROJECT “___________________”  
 
Between the undersigned, _______________________, who is of legal age, is a resident of 
and is domiciled in __________, is identified with Colombian Citizenship Card No. 
_________________ issued in ________________, is acting in the capacity of 
_________________, and on behalf and in representation of __________________, 
hereinafter referred to as UNIVERSITY or HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION (IES in 
Spanish) and, on the other hand, _____________________, who is of legal age, is a resident 
of and is domiciled in __________________, is identified with Colombian Citizenship Card No. 
_________________ issued in ________________, is acting in the capacity of 
_________________, and on behalf and in representation of __________________, 
hereinafter referred to as DELIVERY ENTITY, have agreed to sign this intellectual property 
and confidentiality agreement regarding the results derived from the delivery of the 
_________________ scientific, technological development or innovation project, hereinafter 
referred to as THE PROJECT, which has been submitted by the DELIVERY ENTITY to 
COLCIENCIAS through researchers, research groups or centres, [or] technological 
developments recognised by COLCIENCIAS, and the investment or donation for which shall 
be made in 2016.  
 
The above is based on the following recitals:  
 
1. Law 29 of 1990, "by which provisions are set forth for promoting scientific research and 
technological development, and special powers are granted", establishes in its Article 1: "the 
State is responsible for promoting and directing scientific and technological advancement and 
is therefore required to include science and technology in Colombia's economic and social 
development plans and programmes, and formulate science and technology plans for both the 
medium and the long term. Furthermore, the State shall establish mechanisms to connect its 
scientific and technological development activities with the activities in the same fields that are 
carried out by Colombian universities, scientific community, and private sector." 2. The 
aforementioned law granted special powers to the Colombian Government by stipulating the 
following in Subsection 2 of Article 11: “to set out the rules which must be followed by the 
nation and its decentralised entities when associating with third parties in scientific and 
technological activities, research projects, and technology creation" and in Subsection 4: " to 
regulate specific types of agreements for promoting scientific and technological activities." In 
the use of said special powers, the Colombian Government issued Law Decree 393 of 1991, 
"by which rules are set out regarding associations for scientific and technological activities, 
research projects, and technology creation", and Law Decree 591 of 1991, “by which specific 
types of agreements for the promotion of scientific and technological activities are regulated." 
3. Law 80 of 1993 was enacted and its Article 32 defined state contracts as: “all binding legal 
actions entered into by entities referred into in this statute, provided by private law or special 
provisions, or derived from the exercise of free will..." 4. The Congress of Colombia issued 
Law 1280 of 2009 by which “Law 29 of 1990 is modified, transforming COLCIENCIAS into the 
Administrative Department for Science, Technology and Innovation, the National Science, 
Technology and Innovation System is strengthened, and other provisions are set forth." 
Furthermore, Subsection 1 of Article 33 stipulates: “Article 33. Activities, contracts and 
agreements made with the purpose of carrying out science, technology and innovation 
activities, and entered into by state entities shall continue to be governed by applicable special 
rules. In consequence, such contracts shall be entered into directly…” 5. In accordance with 
the above, it is concluded that contracts entered into with the purpose of promoting science, 
technology and innovation are regulated by Law Decrees 393 and 591 of 1991, and are also 
subject to Law 80 of 1993 in all other aspects not regulated by said decrees. 6. According to 
Law 1286 of 2009, the Administrative Department for Science, Technology and Innovation 
(COLCIENCIAS) is the governing entity of the National Science, Technology and Innovation 
 System (SNCTeI in Spanish), and is in charge of directing, coordinating and promoting 
scientific and technological development and innovation in Colombia. In compliance with its 
mission and legal mandate, COLCIENCIAS promotes the generation and transfer of scientific 
knowledge, technological development and innovations that will allow, on the one hand, the 
consolidation of a scientific community in different knowledge fields and, on the other hand, a 
contribution to Colombia's economic and social development. 7. Article 10 of Law 1753 of 
2015 stipulates: “Article 10. Intellectual property rights for research and development projects 
funded with public resources. In the case of research and development projects in science, 
technology and innovation and information technology and communications that are carried 
out with public resources, the State may assign free of charge, except for national security and 
defence reasons, the intellectual property rights it holds, and approve their transfer, marketing 
and exploitation to whoever carries out a project, without constituting economic damage to the 
State. The conditions for assignment shall be established in the respective contract and, in all 
cases, the State reserves the right to obtain a non-exclusive free licence to said intellectual 
property rights for reasons of national interest." 8. Intellectual property means creations 
derived from human intellect in the industrial, scientific, literary and artistic spheres, with the 
implication that the holder of said intellectual property must be aware of and understand the 
rules that govern its creation, maintenance, defence and expiration, with the purpose of 
protecting one of the most valuable assets a natural or legal person can ever own. 9. 
Intellectual property is divided into two categories: a) Industrial property, which is the exclusive 
right a natural or legal person holds over an invention, an industrial design or a distinctive sign. 
Furthermore, industrial property is divided into two branches. The first one is New Creations, 
which include all invention patents, utility model patents, industrial designs, and integrated 
circuit etching patterns. The second one refers to Distinctive Signs, which include brands, 
commercial slogans, trade names, commercial logos, and designations of origin. b) Copyright, 
which is a set of rules intended to protect the authors and owners of artistic, scientific and 
literary works, and grants them the power to control all matters related to the use and 
exploitation of their work regardless of its use and the way or form it is expressed. Thus, 
copyright protects: Books, pamphlets and written documents, conferences, speeches, 
sermons and other works of a similar nature, musicals, dramas, choreographies, pantomimes, 
musical compositions with or without lyrics, film works, videogrammes, drawings, paintings, 
architectural works, sculptures, engravings, lithographs, photographic works, applied art 
works, illustrations, maps, plans, sketches, plastic art works relative to geography, topography, 
architecture or the sciences, computer programmes, databases and multimedia creations; in 
short, all literary or artistic productions that can be reproduced or defined by any printing or 
reproduction method, including phonography, radio telephony or any other means that are or 
could be known. 10. It is very important to be aware of the content of the categories of 
intellectual property rights, that is copyright and industrial property rights, where copyright 
includes moral rights and economic rights. Regarding the former, they are highly personal 
rights which safeguard the link between the author and his or her work; they are perpetual, 
inalienable, non-attachable, non-transferable and non-waivable, and cannot be sold or 
transferred. Moral rights grant the following powers over a work: Paternity right, the right to 
withdraw the work or to repent, integrity right, the right to keep the work unpublished, and the 
right to modify it. Regarding the latter, that is, the economic rights, they enable the author or 
any other natural or legal person that has acquired the copyright, to control the work and 
obtain an economic benefit from allowing the work to be used. The holder of economic rights 
has the exclusive power to approve or forbid actions such as the work's reproduction, 
translation, adaptation, modification, publication by any means, and distribution. Regarding 
industrial property, it contains strictly economic rights when exercising in rem property rights, 
that is, use, enjoyment and disposal with exclusivity over third parties. Therefore, the holder 
shall have the power of exploitation, directly or through third parties, by entering into use 
licence agreements. In light of the above recitals, THE PARTIES agree to the following 
clauses:
