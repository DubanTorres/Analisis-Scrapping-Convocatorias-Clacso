1. Background 
 
The joint funders have a strong commitment to supporting research that aims to 
improve health policy and systems for vulnerable communities in Brazil. Since its launch 
in 1990 Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) has seen a fundamental restructuring of the 
Brazilian Health System. Underpinned by political vision and gradual increase in available 
funds for public health SUS has contributed to improvement in access to health services 
in Brazil.  
 
The decentralisation of health system decision making and delivery alongside revised 
arrangements for responsibilities across federal, state and municipal levels have been 
fundamental to Brazils move towards attainment of Universal Health Coverage. As the 
health system continues to evolve there is growing recognition that the challenges 
confronting health systems strengthening transcend disciplinary boundaries, highlighting 
the need for research to foster genuine interdisciplinary collaborations across social 
science, biomedical science, and other disciplines to address these complex challenges.

2. Call scope 
 
2.1 The proposed MRC-CONFAP call for health systems research networks seeks to 
support UK-Brazil partnerships working to identify research questioned focused on 
improving the health system and health care for vulnerable communities in Brazil.  
 
2.2 The UK-Brazil network must include at least two participating Brazilian State Funding 
Agencies (“FAP”) in Brazil and one UK partner. 
 
2.3 The joint funders seek interdisciplinary proposals from UK-Brazil networks that aim 
to address health systems challenges in Brazil. Proposals must describe how and why the 
proposed UK-Brazil network would be best placed to develop projects that would have 
the potential to improve the health of vulnerable communities in Brazil. 
 
2.4 Proposed research activities should aim to provide evidence to strengthen the 
Brazilian health system and improve health outcomes. The joint funders will award 
proposals for rigorous, high quality research that will: 
 
2.4.1. Generate evidence on how to strengthen the health system and improve 
health outcomes in Brazil. 
 
2.4.2 Inform the delivery of evidence-based interventions or structural changes. 
  
 2.4.3 Provide evidence that is of direct relevance to decision makers and users in 
the field. 
 
2.5 Applicants must demonstrate a clear and strong rationale for how their proposed 
network and research, as well as the approach taken, meets the criteria for world-class 
and cutting-edge policy-relevant research addressing key questions on strengthening 
health systems in Brazil. 
 
3. Research impact 
 
3.1 Applicants must identify the potential impacts of their research on policy and practice 
and outline clear relevance to decision makers and practitioners.  
 
3.2 Projects should identify and address the key barriers to implementation and uptake 
of evidence-based interventions at local and national levels, paving the way for their 
successful adoption into routine practice with improved access and use by the 
populations in need. 
 
3.3 Solutions to strengthening health systems in Brazil must be rooted in, and  
acceptable to, the institutions, communities, and societies where they will operate. As 
such, non-academic stakeholders, including potential users of the research, are expected 
to be included and involved in the design and delivery of projects. Indeed, proposals 
should demonstrate strong engagement with stakeholders and decision makers from the 
project inception stage and include appropriate budget for such activities.

3.4 Researchers are encouraged to be innovative in the kinds of user engagement, 
knowledge exchange, communications and research uptake activities they plan to 
undertake during and beyond the period of research funding. It is important that 
applicants appreciate that outreach and engagement activities in themselves do not 
constitute impact.  
4. Assessment criteria 
 
4.1 To be funded, proposals must be internationally competitive and at a standard 
equivalent to that normally expected to be supported by each joint funder.  
 
4.2 Assessment criteria follow the following headings, full details can be found in the 
guidance for applicants: 
 
4.2.1. Research Quality 
4.2.2. Impact 
4.2.3. Research Management, People and Partnership  
4.2.4. Methodology 
4.2.5. Ethics 
4.2.6. Data Management Plan  
4.2.7. Resources Requested 
4.2.8. Official Development Assistance (ODA) compliance 
 
4.3 Applications received and comments for all peer-reviews will be assessed by a joint 
Research Panel in January 2018. 
 
5. Funding & Eligibility 
 
5.1 This call funds partnership working between UK and Brazilian researchers. Each 
network must be interdisciplinary and include researchers from at least 2 (no more than 
4) participating FAPs in Brazil, and at least one UK partner. 
 
5.2 The MRC will make up to £2.0m available for this scheme to fund the UK 
collaborators. The £2m made available by the UK funders will be matched with 
equivalent effort from the Brazilian FAPs, who will fund the Brazilian collaborators. 
 
5.3 The agencies would expect to fund approximately 8-12 projects in total. The size of 
the grants will vary according to the needs of each research project. 
 
5.4 Applicants do not need to request equal amounts from both sides. The difference in 
values should reflect the difference in costs covered and local prices. The agencies also 
expect the costs on each side to accurately reflect the research effort to be carried out. 
It is expected that the research effort on both sides is comparable. 
 
5.5 UK and Brazilian applicants are allowed to participate in 1 (one) proposal as Principal 
Investigator (PI) and an additional proposal as co-Principal Investigator. Multiple 
                       
4 
 
submissions from researchers of the same Institution of Higher Education and Research 
is permissible. 
 
For funding support under this call, applicants must be eligible to apply for funding from 
their respective country’s funding agency: 
 
5.5 UK Applicants:  
 
For the UK applicants, standard RCUK/MRC eligibility criteria as described in the MRC
